okay guys so I said that I would split out the examples that obviously I'm going to show you of me going through the chart and firstly this is cumulative Delta you'll see on your template just just basically minimize this get rid of it because it's not relevant at this stage we will cover it a bit later on again it's no magic okay it's just a rough guideline of which market orders winning the battle so to speak you know balance imbalance that kind of thing so it's just a different way of looking at the same data you've already looked at on the depth of market if you've done the footprint obviously you would have seen it there and so on and so forth so just put that aside don't get you know fixated on that whatever you might have seen it just ignore it for now minimize it this is very much about establishing the market condition and at the moment obviously each environment you know it's March what I've done is I've gone back 60 days is plenty of data for me to cover with you I'll do a little bit of crude oil as well just to wrap it up but essentially I'm gonna go through loads of them with you so there's plenty it's not like profiles where obviously we're just merging move on merging move on here I am going to spend a little bit of time determining market condition but you know as with the profiles I've said it time and time again and I don't want to you know sound like a broken record I always say this but honestly I wish I was told this early on in my career not to be so obsessive about these lines I've told you already that the statistics isn't perfect you know these lines are just very rough guidelines when I was actually a proprietary trading firm and I was being shown balance and imbalance obviously it's not something I invented there's a lot of stuff that I've obviously created my own way of showing you things but it's happening in the real world right I haven't invented how eBay works how a you know auction market process works in all the many markets I've showed you it's just real life all I've done is I've just sort of created a vehicle ie my course to enable that knowledge to funnel its way to you that's all I've really done I've just shown you what's already going on you probably just weren't aware of it and you know similarly I say all of this because I was shown this but I was shown it in a very systematic way is my point almost indicator like even in a top institution and it took me a long time to step away from it and actually in hindsight you know I don't think it was ever done to intentionally mislead and actually I've had a look obviously I have a lot of contacts okay in some of the biggest institutions in the world proprietary trading firms I know a lot of them and I've seen their training material and it is very sort of methodical and systematic in the way they teach you imbalance and balance and I'm they're basically teaching it to you fairly similarly and obviously I did say to you my job is to replicate exactly what you get in a professional firm so I am giving you that this is exactly the framework that they're going to teach you how do you tell if the markets gone imbalanced well the VWAP starts to format a gradient and obviously we will be developing market orders under the VWAP and therefore we're in balance the same sort of stuff I showed you but to maybe 10-20% of the detail that I've been showing you and more importantly I'm basically telling you to be very loose with it so let's get started so what are we trying to do what we need to do is right so I've given you that list look again that list is just a very rough guide I've said it many times before you know on a discretionary basis we're not talking about you know I've not talked about this before we're not talking about systematic trading here I'm talking about developing as a retail institutional sort of merge between a home trader using institutional tools you don't have the sort of algorithmic capabilities that some of these institutions do so at the end of the day you want to develop that edge like I said and actually it's the final point I apologize but it's really important because I have said it before you know I've already said to you that if it was that easy right to identify this type of rhythm with a algorithm or through some systematic method guys there's no point you doing it okay I can assure you some institution out there or some guy out there with incredible programming ability and probably a lot of funding as well and time or whatever it is and in particular an institution guys they're gonna eat this edge away like that you are wasting your time if you think that this is some sort of system that oh look every time we bounce here is perfect and that's it it's the road to me now identifying the perfect sort of entry no it's not that actually it comes back to what I've said many times we have a huge advantage over machines because a machine will drive itself crazy trying to figure out hmm is that a slow trend have I broken the VWAP oh actually maybe the slow trend is ending you see we can use our logic and actually make a discretionary decision and I love this I told you when we've got the merges I love it when it's unclear it's that I know hang on a minute maybe I can develop some edge over the majority of the market that haven't realized until it's too late for example the markets already moved that oh this was actually approximately a slow trend right we popped above the VWAP slightly but we didn't really build any volume above here for me personally as someone who's using my observation and judgment and therefore I sense a short opportunity here but by the time the rest of the market and algorithms and so on and so forth realize that you know whatever the shape of the profile might be obviously we're going to have a lot of volume built in sort of this region and then you know you could imagine there's going to be possibly and in fact that's not very accurate apologize let me just do that again you'll see where I'm getting at with this so there'll be probably a little bit of obviously volume there and then we'll have quite a bit of volume in this region be like something like that anyway and then maybe you'll have your you know your standard deviation in the volume profile as I've said the fair price fair value you know the 70% or whatever you want to call it that a lot of these obviously traders institutional traders algorithms whatever are programmed to read can you see by the time it's gone through the volume profile sort of value area low as we call it guys it's too late that's why all and I can assure you this if we looked at it on the cumulative Delta which we won't huge amount of orders coming in because the market recognizes this is imbalance guys you're in up here because you've recognized the rhythm was what slow trend this is my point you cannot begin to understand the edge you can develop I'm not saying it's easy of course it will take you hours like hundreds if not thousands of hours of developing watching this again and again and again before you know before you used to take me for example you know like I said maybe an hour to do my prep now I can literally come in and I'll see this and straight away I will know oh okay we've got a slow trend and if I've got some contextual reason I don't know some like I've said some multi-day composite up here and you know I'm looking for that and I'm looking for it to get sure and I see this imbalance and then I see some absorption up here you know the buyers being absorbed and I see some aggression coming in guys I'm gonna be all over this because I've seen this a million times it's the first time the second time the 10th time the 50th time maybe even the hundredth time obviously I'm not going to be so certain it's going to take a little bit of developing and I hope that helps you and you don't think I'm just blabbering for the sake of it actually I'm trying to you know impart with you some of this knowledge that I've built up over many years that why it's so important that you approach this in not a sort of systematic manner you've got to realize this is where your edge is over an algorithm because I'm this again I'm gonna repeat the point but you know if it was perfect like bounce off VWAP bounce off VWAP bounce off VWAP every single time guys I can assure you you know some institution put a few million into this develop something bang your edge will be eaten up by the time you know algorithm comes in it's gone and you know like we've seen on the depth of market nowadays where obviously machines are incredibly sophisticated at reading absorption and things like that a microscopic level there's no edge there wouldn't be any edge here it's good that it's loose embrace it use your judgment and actually feel good that it's a chance for you to showcase your skill and develop your edge over other traders out there alright so that's enough on that let's crack on and let's look at so don't forget what's the purpose of this we're looking to on the sheet which unfortunately I don't have in front of me obviously I just do this naturally now so I apologize if I use some words that aren't on the sheet but hopefully it'll be obvious what I'm trying to achieve here and that is so we're looking at obviously we're looking at the market condition so that's simply balanced or imbalanced again sometimes I call it rotational same thing right just rotating or are we imbalanced and like I said this will form part of my prep every day so it's important that you identify the condition and then I'm looking at the rhythm okay and then we will obviously try and identify when there's a shift obviously we talked about it right we called it like obviously a reversal day where you go from imbalance back into balance because you might be in a trend and then it breaks away from the imbalance or the trend if you want to call it a trend is fine I've said or we can call it what was the other one breakout day okay and that's just literally going from balance to imbalance so let's try and identify those and I apologize obviously I'm doing a lot of days and I'm doing them very quickly if I forget to identify anything I do apologize in advance but let's crack on with that and just final point is obviously that's the start of the session so this session here to here guys sorry that's that should be a straight line there that's the electronic trading hour session okay there to there okay that's the ETH and then up until 4.15 which is just before the ETH sorry terrible line but you know that should be a straight line and this I've put it in here that's the open of the S&P 500 futures okay it's at 9.30 so this is the pit session so that's RTH and then so this is RTH to 16.15 okay when you go into your chart settings you'll see it this is the ETH okay I mean for our purposes don't worry about it too much we'll talk about a lot more later I just want you to be aware of what this line is because at the open you do get a lot of market orders coming in people like to get their business done for the day or you know institutions like to fill client orders at the open and stuff so there'll be a lot of volatility sometimes at the open so I have marked it but don't worry we'll just ignore it for now so let's go through them anyway so on this day we have what's happening here so I've taken off the volume profile right and essentially we've had a fairly I would I would say this was a fairly imbalanced overnight session so the ETH until the RTH opens we call it the overnight which I mentioned before and then our market profile starts at the open right but it's nice to see what happened overnight can you see I would say almost that is what imbalanced right we've had an imbalanced session and I would say fairly slow trend because what VWAP okay so what that means is if we come up here and I know it's easy for me to say this in hindsight but don't worry about all of that I don't use VWAP on its own to trade I just want you to identify market condition right now we'll worry about trading later obviously start to think about trading opportunities but I don't want you taking trades right now because we're going to use this in conjunction with other context contextual clues for example obviously where we look for is their static historical value fair price ie composites don't worry about taking trades for now just start to think about you know if I was just trading a slow trend environment oh look trading opportunity okay then you had some volume here and the market continued down down so basically would you agree this day was very much a you can call it a trend day if you want but it's going to put you imbalanced and then what was the so that was the market condition and then what was the rhythm I'm just going to start putting should I call this MC and then our rhythm okay rhythm was slow trend guys if you see it differently it's fine like I said there would be no edge if everyone in the world saw this exactly the same way there wouldn't be an edge okay I can assure you it's fine if you see it slightly differently you could even argue right that over here the market condition changed do you see can you see that we went from a slow trend to a fast trend because why 1.5 and then towards the end of the day we broke the fast trend and potentially you could have played a reversion back to the VWAP okay but end of the day depends on microscopic you want to get so you could have argued this was a very late reversal day I haven't really covered this because it happened so late in the session for me this was very much you know 90% of the day was a imbalanced day but yeah like I said you know you could quite easily argue with me hang on a bit that we just flip from a sort of slow trend day to a fast trend day let's get a bit of a move on now so that was the first day let's have a look at this second day so again this is all I want you to do I just want you to get used to identifying market condition and then the rhythm of that market condition and then obviously if the day type changes dramatically you can think about calling it a reversal or potential reversal day etc because you can trade it accordingly so very much here again as we come into the open so I didn't say this before but maybe try to think about the overnight session you know what would we like because typically as I said I do trade I like to trade around the open I've mentioned this before maybe half an hour before the open because that's when the volume comes in typically obviously during volatile periods stops being taken out overnight you can get some quite a bit of hefty volume overnight but historically I've never really fine I don't care if that happens it happens I don't really get involved in any of that I prefer to just be involved more during the pit session I'm very much an RTH trader however if something's setting up before 9.30 in the e-mini S&P and then obviously before 9 o'clock just before 9 going into the crude oil pit open I'll take it but I like to see what's the market condition as I'm coming into the new day so in fact apologies I didn't say that before have a think about anyway overnight what's happening here so again can you see very imbalanced right think about the profile probably quite thin here and then the distribution will obviously build here right in this area so you can very much see the weighted average price was moving down down down which is reflected in quite aggressive behavior of the VWAP you wouldn't really want to fade this market all other things being equal obviously we don't know the context we don't know any of the other investor horizons in terms of we could have a monthly VWAP crossing here and you'll see all of this later this is why I say don't take trades just think of condition okay so this alone clearly imbalanced and so imbalanced overnight rhythm was what probably quite a slow trend right because this is the 0.5 and you can see the retracements were fairly deep right then we do can you see at the open a huge amount of orders came in but actually the rhythm didn't really change that much obviously because the price moved a lot we did get some sort of expansion probably in terms of the spread right standard deviation or whatever but again don't worry too much about that the point is did we see any shifting rhythm no you know shorting if you were shorting here you'd want to be shorting approximately here you don't be shorting approximately here okay you may have tried a short here and obviously you'd have got stopped out because the rhythm changed so this is a day where potentially you could argue that we turned into what do you call it you see I don't even use these day types I hate them to be honest I just I just think of it as the rhythms basically changing I have an opportunity to get back into balance but fine I think I called it a reversal day right so you see I want you to think about oh this could be a reversal day so a potential opportunity to go to the other side and actually be the other side there but don't worry too much about the targets right now you know I talked about in the value expectations it's very similar can you see when you go into a rotation environment I talked about one of the expectations being going to the other side right so you know those tend to be good targets but let's not get into that right now point is all I want you to do is identify market condition and can you see here it changed again we tried to go imbalanced and it failed and then the market got sorry we tried to go we tried to go rotational as in go back and you see that we went above VWAP VWAP became flat and then but really we didn't kind of I haven't got the volume profile here but actually if you look at it what all the markets done it's got attracted to volume earlier in the day in this region and it's just testing are these players still finding this area fair value I know this is a bit advanced but I'm just trying to tell you why the markets done this it's come back here to test it is that fair value market said nope let's carry on then and I'm there anyway and then we go back to a rhythm change again this area and the thing is the reason I want you to do this is because what happens is if you can identify this you can identify trading opportunities so like I said if you can identify very early on that are look we've had one two three sort of tests two tests three two there's no rule okay it's not like a trend line where you have three bounces and all that nonsense it's get a feel for it okay you look at all the flow you look at the profile you look at how thick it is where it's developing how convinced is the market comes with time but you can also use a bit of logic and common sense and say all right we've tested tested maybe the third time we test there's an opportunity here there's an opportunity here there's an opportunity here there's potentially an opportunity can you see the rhythm here there's an opportunity in this area here there's an opportunity but actually it's a stop out we change maybe I can get long actually that didn't work out fine and this is obviously very powerful because you see this rotational move failed we come back we test again the 0.5 fine let me try to get in balance shorts again short here because it's similar to earlier in the day can you see that I hope this is obvious and you see it here you see it here guys great opportunities to short okay but I'm just trying to get you to identify this condition so let's move on anyway so then we come to the next day and I'm gonna try and move a little bit faster you get the gist of it guys you can get as microscopic as you want or I like to be a little bit more loose with it but obviously it's up to you so again what did I say overnight very much were imbalanced right what was the rhythm slow trend imbalance apologies terrible writing well that's guys write it down always when you're doing this just write down market condition balanced or imbalanced essentially day type I mean a rotational environment look at the shape of the VWAP you know these are the sort of things I'd be looking at if you're here and you're thinking to yourself I'm not sure is that balance or imbalance guys look at the shape of the VWAP the mean is moving up market orders the data is coming into the distribution at a higher level is shifting the mean isn't it we talked to this is what I had to talk about a lot of the statistics because otherwise you just treat this as an indicator I don't want you to I want you to think about you know the market is imbalanced in terms of market orders on the depth of market aggressive buyers versus sellers market orders are coming in on the distribution the distribution may have started out fairly balanced here but now we're starting to build here okay so it's becoming imbalanced and again the VWAP balance is just there to help you understand how the shape of profile is developing on an intra period basis just happens to be the day so okay so that's slow trend then guys you've got to be able to recognize this why because you test it once here you know you can either just obviously you know it's the first time we're retesting it if you've got a strong conviction for whatever reason that we're gonna get long obviously this would be a good area to get long because you've established the rhythm then again here can you see that establish the rhythm then we do what fail okay and we turn into a reversal day right that's a reversal day can you see how we go from imbalance to balance rotation environment okay rest of the day was rotation rhythm was what one SD not two SD see that on the rotation then later in the day obviously we'd break out okay so this ignoring the late day obviously surge was very much an imbalance day turning into balance imbalance to rotational environment so very much a change we had a change that's just a sign for Delo it just means change in market condition okay so what do we do about that well if you'd recognize this early on there's a shorting opportunity there to take it to the other side of balance okay we'll talk more about trading opportunities obviously when we combine this with other contextual factors in particular what you've been doing the merges okay now let's move forward okay so this day was a bit of a day here and for whatever reason it's not showing the the open but obviously there was this there was a surge it was probably something over the weekend or something had happened there but because it's a Sunday Monday but anyway it's irrelevant the point is this is what to me to me again depending on what sort of how microscopic you want to get what's the market condition to me this is a rotation balance because what are we doing I mean probably I wouldn't even mark that but basically we're rotating as we come down here then we come up here I'd probably be looking for shorting opportunities there I might be looking to get long here or here might have got stopped out on that one but essentially to me is very balanced and look at the VWAP flat massive clue that this is you know obviously a rotational environment the reason why I say look it depends how microscopic you want to get because obviously for some on a very microscopic level you could say well we had aggressive imbalance which failed and then we went rotation okay obviously to me that's I'm not going to look at it that way it's too too small a time horizon for me for me the way I like to trade that's probably you could even mark it like that you know it's just a very rotational day which is great because then I know I'm looking for mean reversion opportunities in line with my other context okay so let's move on sorry it's because I'm using this marker at the same time it's trying to get three four different types of mouse buttons going at the same time all right so now we come into this day again I'm not skipping days the same way I didn't skip any composites I want it to be challenging throw any of these at me and I'll tell you what I think the market condition is and like I said I'll make a decision and I'll go with it that's my edge you have to have 100% confidence in your edge and let the market teach you let the market tell you obviously I'm here if you show me and say look Envy I thought this was the market condition that today what do you think I'm gonna give you my opinion but as long as you know so you know I said this before when we did the composites you know so for me very rotational environment and then maybe you know changes slightly there but the point is if you're looking at the market up until this stage and it's rotation right at the end of the day is even if you you look at it slightly differently so you look at this leg this leg this leg this leg you see you've got a couple of extra legs there but you say Envy that's how I see it I won't say to you nah that's wrong of course I'm gonna say yeah looks reasonable to me it's a rotational environment if you start saying to me oh I see this as a imbalanced day obviously I'm gonna say to you you know like if you try and merge balance here balance here and you say I'm gonna merge those two all right clearly something we're not you know I'm not explaining it properly you know we need to sit down again and that's fine don't worry about it happens but generally I said this before in the merging just be rough because you will gain an incredible edge then and you know by being loose potentially if you do it correctly in terms of at least relative to how the market eventually sees it you can have an incredible edge so I hope that you see that I hope that gives you confidence to just make decisions okay so here what happened here for me initially the market condition was balanced right or rotational or whatever so when we came up here we came down here I probably might have been looking to fade the market as we sort of broke this little micro structure here we'll talk a little bit about this later don't worry about this too much might have been able to get some lungs in then obviously look the rhythm was 2 SD wasn't it 2 SD second standard deviation here we did I agree we did break here but then we came back in and really we I would say you know that break was on very little volume it's not like we stayed up here for ages and we built volume market orders we didn't really we flipped back very quickly I'm not saying I would have got short here and allowed it to go against me everyone's different risk tolerance whatever order flow that you see etc etc conviction this is why no two people will ever trade the same way you'll never get the same entries approximately there's a good chance a big percentage of the time we could be reading this as a rotational market and in particular if you think this has gone up and maybe your rotation might be failing look how quickly it goes back into rotation as in from imbalance and then rotation if you class that to be an imbalance again it's judgment isn't it so we come back into a rotation but something has changed hasn't it because look here we go up we test it again nope okay so it does ever so subtly change from a rotational in my opinion okay and you see the thing is as long as you have logic behind it and it's not wild it's okay okay generally you're gonna be okay as long as you apply some decent logic to it because think about it my logic is well I've just gone up here and I've just obviously gone so if imbalanced up imbalanced down imbalanced up which is rotation essentially right we're going up and down and the profile is obviously very balanced we're going up we come back down do you see according to my rhythm I should be doing what there there clearly something has changed okay we've turned into a very slow trend okay and in fact you can see it it's very subtle okay what should have happened is this VWAP should have been pretty flat like that had we have continued the rotation but it wasn't she's got very so slight angle to it and that's because the market condition changed and then but there wasn't an opportunity to get any sort of trades in here it was too late at the end of the day but the condition changed in my opinion probably somewhere around here because you know we tested it and then you could argue it happened there but then the second time we tested it and failed clearly the rotational ended there so we went ever so subtly from rotation to an imbalance a slow trade imbalance so you can see it's almost like a breakout day but it wasn't very aggressive right we didn't really have a fast imbalance so hopefully that makes sense let's just move on because obviously we've got a lot to cover okay I'm going to try and speed through some of these because obviously I've got like I said I've got a lot of days to cover and hopefully because I went into so much detail in the early ones so there I would call that slow trend slow trend here and the slow trend broke VWAP went flat okay so we had a slow trend imbalance market condition was in balance slow trend then we went rotational because the VWAP broke okay we went to the other side of value didn't quite make it to the second standard deviation and then we really went we tried to go in balance and the VWAP became very flat but then look at this do you remember I talked about this in the earlier section where I was describing how look we're building value and then breakout so you could argue we almost went from imbalance to balance to again imbalance because we just basically built a lot of value sorry in this region then we just broke out and we came in balance and then the imbalance turned into a reversal later in the day so actually the imbalance was more like a fast trend then yeah the fast trend just ended and again any attempts to stay in balance in this area failed and boom market recognized that and shot up so hopefully that makes sense you see they're not you could have a number this is why I'm showing you this because even though in theory everything in the books that you read it's all perfect yet trend day imbalanced and if it fails you know we turn into a reversal day and then we stay in balance sorry rotational for the rest of the day complete and utter rubbish guys can you see how many times we change market condition here it happens you've got to accept that sometimes the market is going to change condition multiple times doesn't matter you can't say to the market oh sorry do you know look I'm not trying to patronize anyone obviously I'm trying to get you away from retail thinking where everything has to be according to how some indicator told you it should be no and I've talked about this a lot you know you have to be able to adapt to changing market conditions or you're going to get killed you know volatility can change in an instant and that's essentially what's happening look here you've got range expansion expansion and then we change but then we die down don't we and it changes into a very sort of damp more damp environment and you this is really reflected where the mean is shifting and then it goes flat you have to be able to recognize this okay and what's going to help you do that is by help that by recognizing the changing market condition okay so here we had quite a few changes you know early on in the day like I said we had some imbalance then we tried to go rotational then we went imbalanced again and then the imbalance run rotational again multiple changes so what I deal with it I accept it right I don't try to force my sort of preferences on the market no I want it to be just a couple of market condition changes guys if there's five condition changes I'll deal with it it'll be good for you to see condition changes can happen this one I'm just going to very quickly you know apologize if I miss anything but look rotational environment overnight right then what is this rotation environment I mean okay it's the early market orders obviously it's a bit in terms of the formation of the standard deviations it is a bit volatile because obviously we've only had a bit of data come through as it settles down and more data comes in I think you could argue that we're settling into sort of a first standard deviation rhythm right but then what happens so we come back we test the VWAP according to the rhythm we should have come down here we didn't right we bounced what happened failed about so clearly slow trend so we went from imbalance to slow trend all right so that was a change there again I'm gonna obviously just skip through as quickly as possible so I'll give you guys a wide variety and show you that I don't you know shirk any sort of challenge when it comes to this stuff because end of the day I trade every day I'm gonna face challenges like this every day if I if I say no actually that doesn't look that good I don't know I won't ever be able to trade because then you know I'm gonna be looking for things that don't exist perfect end of the day like I told you I embrace it I like it I like to have some sort of logic that I have to apply so I'm not relying on an indicator to do a job for me end of the day you know happens in any job if you want to get anywhere again I'm not trying to lecture anyone I'm trying to help you to move you away from the mindset that you may have found in obviously the retail sector and try and give you this level of institutional thinking which is the same as in any job right if you want to obviously get ahead and develop edge over your colleagues because you've got to do things differently to them got to start applying a bit of out-of-the-box thinking and it's not that hard in my opinion once you've seen it right a lot of times but you know name me any industry that's different where it doesn't take time to develop that skill so again here to me this is very rotational okay and forgive me but I'm not going to go over the rhythm every single time you get the point we started off very rotational probably not 2SD rhythm more like 1SD 1 to 1.5 right then something changed here we didn't make it to the other side we should have we didn't boom broke volume built and we went it's almost fast trending balanced right that's my take on it if you've got a slightly different take is fine you can show me if you're unsure I'm happy to just have a look at it but as long as you don't do anything crazy like say you know no envy yep agree with you that you know this was a rotational day but actually no it stayed rotational here I mean obviously you know I think I probably will say to you no I would suggest and you're gonna see it you'll have a balanced profile here and then you will towards the end of the day start to build quite a bit of market orders down here in this area and obviously your balanced profile will no longer look like a balanced profile it's gonna look like maybe a double distribution and so on and so forth so it's gonna it's gonna change shape from balance profile so let's move on okay so maybe I'll just probably won't even mark some of these days so I can just cover a little bit more ground that's obviously balanced day where the rhythm is very much a one standard deviation would you agree on this day okay apologies I know my head probably covers some of this this is very much started off as a it's an imbalanced day obviously we spent the whole day above the VWAP you know there's not gonna be many people fading this market guys I can assure you it's a very imbalanced market there's probably quite a bit of aggression coming into the market it could be bigger players which is what typically happens on imbalanced days because what is imbalanced aggressive market orders aggressive buy orders or sell orders so typically it does tend to be sort of bigger investors that are holding buy and hold and so on and so forth especially in the indices in the S&P 500 obviously is very popular for buy and hold strategies etc so yeah the rhythm obviously changed slightly but this is why it's important to recognize that you're in an imbalanced environment because what happens is here you start to go slightly fast guys just the 0.5 or you could even argue it was the one I'm okay with either you see in fact I'll be quite happy if you said to me now Envy I think it's the one because to me I'll be like yeah maybe this guy's getting it you've got to be loose you've got to be loose okay but the danger is if you hadn't recognized that the whole day is above the VWAP as you see this break you could class this as a reversal day right and try to take short positions here and yeah you might have done all right this time but it's dangerous because the whole day guys has been above the VWAP so actually the underlying foundation of this day is very much a trend day and a slow trend day but at points the rhythm increased slightly so just because it breaks this sort of rhythm in this period can you see actually hope that's clear overall is a slow trend so you would want to be very careful here if anything that would be a great opportunity as it turned around to get back into your imbalance and obviously we'll talk about this hopefully you'd have some sort of contextual level down here maybe some sort of big multi-day composite or whatever it is whatever which we'll talk about a little bit later okay this day was just obviously rotational and then it became imbalanced okay so a breakout day classic breakout day right rhythm was and don't forget I want you to mark the rhythm I'm obviously I haven't got time to do every single one some of them are pretty obvious so this is probably a 2SD 2SD fading opportunities right you might have faded that what happens when you break out try and you exit remember what I said the strategies exit and then try and establish what's the rhythm well it's probably more like a fast trend or some sort of normal trend you try and get some lungs in but my point is not you know get your lungs in and I want you to buy no I want you to just recognize that clearly this has become a breakout day fine I accept later on in the day we went came back and we came back to balance okay but it's not the point guys like I said conditions can change multiple times throughout the day the textbooks will say balance to imbalance breakout day job done no we clearly came back here the market the breakout failed essentially this imbalance the market couldn't find value right up here try try to build some value failed you know what didn't work out let's just get back to the VWAP or the VPOC or whatever you want to call it here the mode or whatever essentially the markets just come back to the established value from earlier on in the day this is just classic auction market theory so I'm not going to go over that again we've discussed it quite a few times obviously in stage one okay so that we tried to form a rotation obviously we're imbalanced down then the imbalance down failed and the VWAP tried to go flat but the rotational day also didn't quite happen so actually we went from imbalance to imbalance the other way didn't even put that on your list did I but it's exceptionally rare that that will happen but obviously when that happens is it any surprise we have a powerful trend day or an imbalance day no why because so many people got aggressively short overnight bailing okay I see it but you know it's obviously not a typical day type for you to go imbalance one way then imbalance the other it's more typical to build up some value overnight from which you can build a base off to keep consecutively building value up and up and up it's I'm not saying it's impossible obviously it does happen I'm just saying it's not as common that's all I'm saying again don't take my word for it as I said just just observe it over your next few months as you continue to learn so this day was very much a slow trending balance which failed right and then we kind of went rotational so it's a reversal day wasn't it and then it kind of just even that reversal petered out and we kind of just came back to balance and you see we came back into previously established sort of area so in theory do you know what you could even argue I'd be happy for you to submit say to me do you know what no envy that was a larger rotational day okay got no problem with that just depends on your perspective your horizon right if you don't like a multi-day hold you may even take some shorts down and look to hold this multi-day again it just depends right what your sort of horizon is and stuff everyone's going to be slightly different or how you see it on the day you know everyone's gonna see the sort of rhythm slightly differently but typically you should be able to identify balance or imbalance you know most of the time fairly sort of well with me or someone else or whatever but it's the rhythm where really you can obviously sometimes have differences of opinion and that's fine like I said that's healthy you're gonna be able to develop an edge you know that way because you might have spotted something that I haven't the rest of the market hasn't yet but goes on to spot like I said when the RTH opens you've already spotted it boom it's your edge that's where you make money doing things differently out of the box so this was very much a slow trend overnight then we kind of just increased it didn't we to more of a normal trend rhythm became the imbalance became normal okay so got about a month left to do like I said I don't want to skip any this was very much a rotational day and then breakout day right so again I'm not gonna mark that one this was a funny one actually because we tried to go slow trend so you know obviously once you've established there you might have had some shorting opportunities in here clearly this rhythm yes kind of changed in it kind of tried to go rotational and then it broke out again so it was almost like an imbalance to reversal to breakout can you see that does that make sense your imbalance imbalance failed we go the reversal day in the sense we tried to obviously go rotational but then the rotation failed and we just went into a breakout day right because had this rotation succeeded we would have expected that to obviously go there right simple you know I've talked about this a lot and I know I'm pausing here but I cannot tell you how important this is you may have heard it talked about before you know no indicator in the world is gonna really in this way anyway help you identify market condition as well as you can not you know any way that there might be something out there obviously and obviously algorithms are doing it all the time machines are obviously doing it all the time trying to sort of establish you know are we in value or are we imbalanced out of value seeking fair value elsewhere but not in the way you're able to do it like this because look at it the reason I say that is look at the market is it perfect no isn't is very messy it can be very messy okay it's very messy but if you can somehow see beyond the chaos and just look at it and think for a moment you know maybe so let me give you an example maybe maybe this was a slow trend it just overshot and therefore I got a shortening opportunity there I'm not saying I would see it that way I'm saying you might see it that way can you see got a great edge because when it comes back you recognize that for what it is it's just an overshoot and barely any market orders took place here I'm not saying that I've recognized that I'm just trying to give you an example of how this stuff because you're using your logic incredible edge because by the time and I said this before over here you may have some sort of fairly balanced profile right by the time this sort of thing is broken and obviously ideally that would be to prove my point and I showed this to you before obviously the value area low might be down here for example by the time the market recognizes it you're already in right that's what my point is keep saying it but just just embrace it you know don't worry about it as long as it's approximately right just go for it and learn from the market feedback I assure you you will get much better at this stuff over time you see how I'm just with ease and I'm confident if someone comes along and says to me no you're wrong they better have a very good reason for why I'm wrong they better show me in the profile what's wrong with my identification of market condition that doesn't mean the next day or the next pit session or whatever if the market proves me wrong and that other person who told me I was wrong right that I'm gonna say oh yeah there you go you were right no nonsense I'll still think I was right as long as my logic dictated it you know for example obviously if in this type of environment I'm saying no I think we're going in balance when clearly we've got flat feedback right the means staying put balance profile fine but if someone tries to obviously let's say I do think this is rotational and someone says to me no it's in values I don't care if you know when the RTH opens or this happens and it does eventually go it's just potluck end of the day I'm not a gambler right I don't care if they end up being right or wrong I know that my edge will play out over time and eventually work in my favor because I can't give you the exact number but you know I don't want to say nine times out of ten but because obviously expectancy comes into that and I haven't talked much about that but you know how much you taking on every trade will obviously impact how many times you need to be right win-loss ratio stuff like that I don't really want to get into it but the point is that you know according to my edge if I identify this as a rotation and I get the rhythm right so either obviously 2SD here and you know let's say it did pull back to the 2SD and I'm looking for opportunities here you know enough times if I take enough out the market I know I'm gonna make money over time so I just stick to it right again you develop this over time as you develop more results and you see this playing out give you more confidence so so yeah that was obviously a rotation environment there this was rotational and then we broke out in my opinion this was just a clear imbalance day right guys fairly slow imbalance initially which you can see because the VWAP did start to slow down and then we picked up the pace a little bit and then we went from slow trend to normal trend very much here so you might have had a opportunity to get along there once that was in by established here we went up came back gave an opportunity to get along given obviously if you had the contextual reason to do that which we'll talk about later okay so this thing is very see it again you could see this differently depending on obviously your time horizon I would probably argue that I'd be happy for you to say to me it was a fairly you know rotational day however because obviously generally I'm looking at the market you know on a sort of into the pit session open for me that was very much imbalanced overnight you know fairly aggressive imbalance a normal trend but more aggressive than normal and you can see the VWAP was quite the average was shifting at quite a decent rate the gradient was quite steep and then we kind of broke didn't we so potentially we went from imbalance here to rotation so a reversal day the very much a reversal day for me where we established you know some sort of we tried to sort of go in balance trend whatever you want overnight and then just kind of fell away didn't we didn't really do anything I said they had a very balanced RTH profile so and then I agree we had a little bit of volume towards the end here but essentially it was very much a failure to go and balance them therefore a reversal in my opinion so hopefully that makes sense to you guys sorry I know my head covers some of this stuff possibly so I can't actually see myself right now but I think it does then we have this imbalance day there okay bit messy I agree kind of rotational overnight bit messy and then we started to do you see it's not that difficult to identify guys because here you've got what rotation you could argue 2SD 1SD I'm fine with it whatever you want did it even pull back here no it didn't kept going up kept going up we started building value here where we've built value before I can assure you the profile would have started to build there guys essentially breakout isn't it went from reversal potential to breakout that's my take on that remember market condition and rhythm are the most important things first and then you can worry about is it a reversal do I have opportunities to play a breakout reversal etc etc they do tend to be quite good moves obviously because when market conditions are changing typically what people are trapped aren't they if you think about it like we said when you saw the market condition changes a reversal day breakout there you'll be exiting your position that was part of the strategy wasn't it the plan the suggestion that I gave you so you can believe you know you can imagine you're not the only guys that are going to be doing that there's gonna be a lot of other guys doing that as well so here we're probably quite rotational and then obviously we went into some sort of slow trend right you could argue kind of some sort of breakout above this overnight value but it's pretty tame wasn't it really and then even the breakout failed there so you kind of had to you had one market condition change and then back to the sort of overnight value this is why I said this what I said before you know you're gonna get sometimes multiple condition changes just got to live with it you got to adapt to it if you expect it to adapt to you you're finished you're not gonna make it in this game you got and I learned that the hard way believe me even I was stubborn I thought no you know in my training I learned that it should do this it should do that I very quickly learned that you know what market will do what what it wants to do it's people people do what they want right how predictable are people even if they promise you things I'm not saying they don't always pull through they pull through enough and the market kind of if you have a good understanding of value across all different perspectives and there's opportunities generally it does do what you think it's going to do but can also be unpredictable like people and why not because it's people it's all it is market's not some sort of ethereal entity it's just people so sometimes it can have condition changes more than you want it to just happens deal with it okay so here as well I'd call that quite rotational although like with composites you could argue that you know we went rotational and then the rotation kind of failed and we tried to go and balance here as a normal trend and that failed and then we went rotational again right so I'm happy with you doing that like I said it's a judgment thing you know and obviously your horizon if you were taking little little trades here that's fine I've got no problem with that okay this very much started off as kind of a slow to normal trend and then rotational and then the rotation failed okay this one was clearly a reversal day wasn't it but we had kind of a slow imbalance but then it failed and you've got opportunities to trade this reversal back to the other side okay so it's good to identify potential reversals because obviously you can take advantage and get on the back of piggyback the reversal people exiting there's gonna be a lot of shorts here aren't there shorts shorts short short short boom a lot of people getting out okay take advantage of that but don't take trades please I know I've said it before but don't because you're missing it this is just to get you identifying market condition rhythm changes in market condition and so on and so forth when we mix this up with composites and other stuff that's the time to really and you see that this is very much a rotational day easy one there okay this one started off rotational went in balance breakout and then the breakout went reversal right so I'm going to shoot through these what I'm going to do is I'm not going to do I realized because I've gone through this a lot of detail and I hope you see that I think I've covered pretty much what I wanted to in this I don't think you're going to get much out of crude you saw a few of the crude examples I showed you in the on the slides anyway what I'll do is don't worry about it in obviously the when we combine this with the composites and we start looking at contextual trading opportunities with two combined I'll do a lot of crude oil there okay so don't worry I'm gonna mix and match it I think that's a better way for me to do it you're gonna get much more out of it here you've got plenty of opportunities you know I think you're getting it now that essentially yeah so we said already I can't remember if we did this one but this is just rotation right fairly easy this one is a slow trend right I would say if you can just try and be loose with it and just just do it you know you know in a way and that's good isn't it at the end of the day you can be you don't have to stress yourself out thinking did I get it exactly right oh my god I don't know my hypo is wrong because this no go with it and learn from the feedback the market gives you later in the session or later in the week or whatever it is here we've very much what a slow trend right good day plenty of opportunities potentially getting long getting long once we established it earlier in the day we pulled back to it get long pull back to it get long pull back to it get along maybe get stopped out although this was later in the day we'll talk about this you know obviously I'll get you placing trades don't worry we're not far away now we've got to combine this with composites then it will fit in nicely so here obviously we had some imbalance broke didn't it maybe a shorting opportunity there to the other side and then we just want rotation the rest of the day reversal day it's fairly straightforward guys can you see I have not skipped a day every single day I have identified in one of the most crazy markets we've had I'm able to do it no so I have confidence I don't it's not I don't care what anyone else thinks it's that I recognize to be successful in this game I'm gonna have to make decisions tough decisions right and go with them and learn from them and eventually my decisions will get better over time and they have right my sort of results show that but didn't happen overnight the process was I just had to kind of sometimes make a decision I said this so many times and it's funny right I said it so many times in the composite merges don't just make a decision as long as it's logical so this was a tricky one actually because we tried to establish some sort of rotation but to be fair didn't really even establish any rotation we just kind of tried look went down imbalanced down imbalanced up and then really to establish rotation and the view up to go flat which it kind of tried to we would have really needed to test this side so really didn't really do anything overnight and I went down went up I guess you know on a second look at this what's actually happened is so we we had an imbalance fell down that's fine and you see what happened basically went into a normal trend the normal trend failed then it went into some sort of rotation stroke slow trend then the slow trend broke out and we went fast trend so I think probably you could rightly argue this was a trend day but a very very sort of rhythm-changing trend day does that make sense so we're pretty much can you see we hardly traded under the VWAP the entire day so to me this was actually a pretty solid trend day right all the volume it's about the VWAP but what happened is the rhythm kept changing right so normal slow fast so we actually had three rhythms in the day so you know make of that what you will potentially that you might have tried to get along at the open which clearly a lot of people did because there's a quick bailout there then we kind of just turned to mush around the VWAP then we made another attempt and we took off so you might have had some fast trend opportunities there you know I know a lot I'll be honest with you a lot of guys don't like to trade off the VWAP because they see it as quite a balance because it's the average personally I like to trade off it all right so we can talk about that later when we talk about you getting into trades but so for me personally if I felt that this imbalance was going to maintain I might have tried to get along there but obviously I don't know I can't say I don't know pretend and say yeah I would have I don't know depends on all the things I'd be looking at what's going on on all the other horizons alright guys so we're almost there just a few more I'm sure you're looking forward to hearing the end of my voice but we are almost there now so very similar wasn't it this and this where we spent the entire day sorry I'm just sticking up my pen I apologize really we spent the entire day you know here was above the VWAP we've already talked about this day I'm sorry that was a terrible drawing but about the VWAP here same thing guys can you see but again we had rhythm changes so it was kind of like the 0.5 and then the VWAP which is fine because I do consider them both to be slow trends then we kind of try to establish normal there but it wasn't as bad as this one this one obviously went normal slow fast this one fairly slow the whole day can you see that 0 to 0.5 okay and let me have a look actually I'm just looking at the thing yeah slow trend if you see on your sheet it will say 0.5 to the VWAP VWAP is 0 essentially right if you look at your distribution it's basically 0 standard deviation in theory of course there's no spread if you have a sort of sample coming at the mean value then obviously the standard deviation is going to be 0 there so it's in theory is 0 but hopefully that makes sense essentially that's pretty much a slow trend day and the good thing about that is you know obviously if you've got a very strong conviction to get long you can kind of recognize you see you can get potentially you could take some longs in this region and then as it comes back you can get long there just saying you know on a VWAP basis obviously like I said don't take these trades to me this is very much could argue yeah two ways you could either say it was rotational or again as I'm coming into RTH I would have seen this as a normal trend failure okay boom and believe me when you're watching this stuff it's quite clear that many people are watching the same thing because you will see the order flow really speed up here and obviously that's people exiting longs overnight or whatever it is sometimes the order flow can clue you into that this again I'm not going to go over it we had a few of them you had it here as well you see the whole day about VWAP pretty much a slow trend we had some change here normal trend so the market condition was always in balance it's the rhythm changed here a few times we went from slow to normal to slow agreed okay this day was very much again imbalanced and you know we had some rhythm changes from fast to slow to normal to well didn't really do much there did we you can see this was really just building quite a bit of balanced volume in this region I wouldn't even call that imbalance it was very nothing really sort of sideways we've been very frustrated trying to take any imbalance trades there okay last two three four days I think and then we're done so again here maybe overnight we tried some minor imbalances and you know I've talked about this on obviously separate videos in theory you want to be changing I haven't said this I'm using 7,500 you want to be changing this probably to something like a 5,000 volume chart because can you see before almost half of my page has been taken up by a day here these days recently I'm getting lots of little days on and you know the reason for that is because of this obviously we just you might be watching this in a few years time and then fine it'll be different but the time I'm doing this obviously we've had a quite a bit of volatility in the market with the virus stuff and whatever going on and therefore what it was is volumes were really high a month ago or so on because obviously there was activity in the market for whatever reason you know people getting out of equity long buy and hold equity positions there's a lot of volume in the market and what that meant is obviously I needed to have quite a high like maybe 7,500 at times even 10,000 volume bars because otherwise I would have had way too many bars so I did increase it but obviously I would suggest that you bring it back down again now because obviously the volumes decreased so you can see more bars okay I'm not going to do it but you can do that so I've talked a lot in obviously other sections of the pro course about you know why I use volume bars and so on and so forth but typically you know if you maximize it I like to see about half of my screen to be one day here you can see two and the reason for that is I do like to see the previous day and how the previous day kind of happened and then maybe I like to see the profile of the previous day I like to see both days when I maximize it you'll see I actually keep my sorry my chart somewhere here in the corner so typically what I'll have is I'll have like the whole day and then I'll have a little bit of the previous day as well so that's how I do it obviously don't do what I do just because I do it develop it over time see what feels right to you etc etc there's no right or wrong to it be honest when it comes to even the volume bar settings there's no magic so just give me one second so yes so again this was just basically some type of imbalance then rotational and then the rotational we had a breakout there and then obviously we just went sort of sideways isn't it did really nothing much on there very similar look at these days where you know we pretty much hadn't imbalanced the whole day imbalanced the whole day because you're under the VWAP but you just had rhythm changes going on all the time which did kind of make it hard and then towards the end of the day just went sideways didn't it which would have frustrated you on both of these days trying to take short so very similar days okay this was fairly rotational and then we broke out this was an imbalanced day that became reversal right failed where did it fail well let's establish the rhythm this was so important to get the rhythm was approximately normal and it broke here maybe could have got a shorting possibly don't know again just know the reason I say we could have got a shorting I just want you to recognize that the market condition change we went from imbalanced to rotational there very much so and how did we identify that can rhythm changed completely sorry terrible drawing but you know just there basically the rhythm changed do you see I know I keep saying this but I wish I was told this I wasn't do you see the way I'm doing this with my hand and whatever and I'm trying to just say hmm yeah it makes logical can you imagine a machine trying to do this no but on the depth of market they'll kill us this is why I've recognized you know later in my career that this is how I'm gonna have to develop edge you know I don't have that edge necessarily against algorithm so on and so forth let me develop it here so for me this is very much how I define edge and I hope me constantly saying that is clear that I'm doing it for your own benefit because I want you to obviously start to think the same way that I do you know not in a sort of it has to be like this because this happened no be fluid beef you know allow yourself to make decisions why not be confident this is very much rotational and then we broke out towards the end of the day this was very much an imbalanced day above the VWAP sorry I'm being a bit incredibly poor with my drawing of lines that's better isn't it VWAP can you see the whole day was above honestly let's be honest this was an imbalanced day rhythm did change a couple times we went into slow and then just kind of turned to mush there so you know you might have tried to get along and nothing really happened bit of a frustrating end to the day and also do you know what there's nothing wrong with you saying to me well actually do you know what Envy I've got a really strong conviction that the market's gonna sell off at some point today and actually yeah we're in balance the whole day but I'm waiting for a rhythm change so we went you know we had obviously this normal trend then we had the slow trend there we could have had that opportunity because you're establishing what I like to do is I just want to see it established then I will take the opportunity but we'll talk about this later then here again we built some sort of normal trend when it failed I've got no problem with you saying yeah do you know what I want to get short because I've got all this other contextual stuff up here some sort of I don't know composites and whatever got no problem with you getting short but guys just recognize that we spent the entire day above VWAP so you want to be scaling out massively you know you want to be getting your position secure there that's my point don't start getting aggressive in this environment for a rotation because the market is clearly telling you spent the whole day above VWAP don't go for extended targets without scaling it yeah you might make it and then you think oh no no probably just got lucky that happened and maybe the entire market just bailed or whatever something happened but generally it's not gonna happen okay I've already said it the mean is the most the mean is essentially the market in one number so you know it's it's telling you very valuable information and when it's telling you that use it it's my opinion okay that's it we're done that was the last I got this one last day and then we're done so this was very much a rotational day but obviously the rhythm was not so much a 2SD was more 1SD wasn't it 1SD 1SD 1SD you see that your shorting opportunities would have been inside and then we built this value above here some volume broke out okay break out day alright guys I hope that was very useful for you like I said I know I said at the start I might do some CL but don't worry about it I'm gonna do a lot of crude got plenty of examples here it's just pointless me going through more I'll go through market conditions and rhythm changes in crude oil it's very similar to be honest S&P does tend to leave a much more mean reverting don't get me wrong but in terms of identification it's the same thing honestly it's identical the personalities of the market don't get me wrong they tend to be quite different in fact very different crude oil can have market changes sorry market condition changes very quickly okay so I trade it differently on my point is the way I identify market condition and rhythm it's exactly the same I just gonna make no difference to you and again like I said we'll do market condition and rhythm changes when I'm combining crude with the composites you're gonna get it anyway but rather than me doing double work you know sure you appreciate it I've shown you plenty of days I want you to start doing this exercise for a little while and yeah I'll see you in the next section Cheers

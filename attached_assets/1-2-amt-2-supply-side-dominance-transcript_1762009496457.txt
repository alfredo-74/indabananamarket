hello ladies and gentlemen welcome back to part two and i wanted to talk to you about imbalance versus balance as i had suggested but actually what i'm doing all the time is i'm obviously reviewing what i'm putting out and giving as information in terms of the last section and as i said it's very true it's all unscripted you know i don't need to do any research i know this business back to front because it's what i've been doing every day for most of my life so everything i need to know it's there it's just trying to figure out how to get it out so i don't necessarily do any research and i found the best way for me to do that as i've said is yeah i can put a few of these tables together and things that you see sometimes but really it's just coming out i don't know exactly how or in what order or exactly what's going to happen so that's why i like to go and review what i'm doing just to make sure have i missed anything is there anything that i could have explained a little bit more fuller and what i realized is when i was reviewing the last piece of information auction market theory part one towards the end i realized and i'm really glad i did it that i discussed this notion of the supply side being more dominant in more common goods and services that we are used to participating in so don't forget every good or service that you buy is a marketplace in the same way that obviously you see this market in front of you you know and i touched upon it before where i talked about market structure i think that was in the possibly the reality video i can't remember exactly but i talked about it in one of the previous videos that people talk about market structure and they're only talking they they're talking about financial but actually what they don't realize is every single good and service in the world is a market but anyway so coming on to the point so i was talking about this notion of supply being the dominant factor there's this thing i've wanted to introduce at some point in the course that was a major turning point in my career and i know i talked about this in reality check and you might be thinking well hang on didn't you say in the reality check there was certain turning that you know key turning points in your career and this is very much related to that where i talked about giving the market wiggle room and so i realized you know this is a perfect opportunity for me to seize on the fact i mentioned about supply dominance and obviously the webcam market bread market so on and so forth and to really show you why that is the case and um i'm going to say this now but um i'm obviously going to prove it as well to you and that is there's a reason why the failure rate in this business and forget about retailers using retail indicators i don't even include folks in this failure rate because that's zero they're not even part of this data set or worth even including in the data set because they've failed before they've started i'm talking about not only professional traders remember i talked about in the reality check video i said that it's just people using even professional tools so even guys i saw coming into the institution every um you know um sort of recruitment round where we'd have new graduates new people coming in not only graduates but obviously people um who had come from different professions or whatever and decided they wanted to give a crack at trading and we used to get people who would obviously come in through the door and um obviously in the institution we'd put them through the program or the the firm that i worked for um would put them through training and etc etc but so they'd be teaching them all these tools that i'm going to teach you and yet the failure rate was still very high as i said 80 percent 90 percent um and it started to dawn on me why that was it's because i've realized over the um you know period of my career very few people in the market or sorry in the world actually understand what the market is they just don't understand it even these guys coming through professional firms and i realized that's why even when they were given the tools as i'm going to give you very few people make it because they don't actually understand what the market is um so they don't even understand what they're getting themselves into you know it's like if you're going to go into business and you don't understand the market you failed before you started and um what i want to really show you is what the market actually is because if you don't understand what the market is then obviously you know you're in trouble the positive side of this is um you know at the end of this if you can accept this and not only accept what i'm telling you but through evidence see what the marketplace is you're going to be up there with very few people in the world who actually understand this now that's a bold statement so you know don't just take my word for it let me show you why that is and then you know you can decide whether you agree with me and i think you will agree with me um that you're going to be in you know a very small company of people that actually understand it because when you see what i show you and you actually compare it to all the garbage you've been told not only on social media in books on the news everywhere about markets it's going to shock you how few people actually know what a market is as in a financial market so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to crack on and get into it and then we can come back to that point um because you know i don't like to make bold statements without backing them up so it all really started in my career and don't worry i'm not going to give you a whole life story but there was a point in my career when obviously i was working in you know big institutions as you know so i was bound to come across some incredible people and actually and i'm gonna give you like a couple of books that i recommend that you do read i'm very anti books because they are all garbage um but when you go into a professional trading firm there's a couple of books that are um essential compulsory reading they will ask you to read them before you start on the training program and um you know don't forget my whole job here is to replicate a professional firm trading program so it's important i tell you what it's like so you know if you want to really um align yourself with a professional approach then it's probably good to read the books um that they're recommending them to read so one is market wizards and then there's some books on market profile as well which i'll tell you about later when we get into um profile so um highly recommended read market wizards great book basically it's this guy jack schwager you may probably have read it or may not have but um what is this guy he goes around interviewing the most successful traders in the whole world and asks them a book sorry asks them a series of questions and then he makes a book out of it where he interviews these guys and these are like obviously the you know the most highly successful you know making millions tens of millions if not hundreds of millions if not billions and um actually there was a guy that um i used to work close to and um he was in the book and um however the problem was i found it very difficult to i i used to really not like the guy very much i'll be honest with you because every time i tried to ask him anything um a he never had and i don't know whether it was intentional or what or he just never had time for me i don't know if it's because i was a junior and obviously he was this guy doing well and looked up to and um well known i'm not going to say any names but obviously well known and obviously incredibly successful um but the only reason i'm telling you this is because he's in this book market wizards and so i'm thinking wow i need to extract as much information as i can out of him but i'll be honest with you i ended up getting virtually nothing so um you know it was a bit counteractive to be honest but um there was something and i'm coming to the point and it's to do with this what i've written here price 50 50 so one of the very few moments where he did actually give me a few minutes of his time so he would say things like you know when i try and ask him about the market and what his view was and you know why did he think that the market was going to go up he'd say things to me like um well i thought that there would be more buyers than sellers and then if it was going down he'd say more sellers than buyers you see what i mean it's like i think it was i just felt like he was winding me up however there's one thing he said to me that really stuck in my mind and he said to me you're never going to succeed in this business unless you realize that individual individual price points the chances of the market moving are 50 50 right and honestly this i just couldn't get this out of my head for the early i mean i was very fortunate obviously i did okay using depth of market and techniques obviously volume analysis on the depth of market but so it was lucky it was enough to keep me in the game keep me profitable enough to sustain and keep me having a full-time career out of it but i really never got you know that like i talked about earlier in my career in the reality check you know as you see with some of my stats i put out and i really never got to that stage where it just started to get exponential the trading was until as you understood what this actually meant that at every single point in the market there's only a 50 50 chance of the market moving up and down so and i think this is the problem of most people that approach the market would you agree that when people open up their chart they look at where the market is and they think oh it's cheap oh it's expensive you've got to understand that at individual price points the market is not cheap and it isn't expensive it's 50 50 at every single i cannot say this to you enough and look don't worry you're not going to get this immediately you might have to go and watch this a few times but i can promise you it's gonna increase your chances of success by like a million percent if you can understand this concept of every single time you're watching your chart and you're watching price move up and down price move up and down the opportunities are 50 50 and it's so difficult for people to grasp this concept because what are people always talking about they're saying oh the market's cheap buy it um you know this fibonacci level 50 percent retracement so the market's cheap i cannot tell you how ridiculous that thinking is and how far away from the truth you wouldn't even believe the way that you've probably been thinking about the market is um and you just have to recognize what the market is that at every single price point the market every single opportunity or profit opportunity is already priced in there is no more than a 50 chance of the market moving up and down at every price point so anyway i'm telling you this and um you know there's a lot of stuff that i've told you that without getting you on the depth of market or allowing you or giving you some evidence that it'd be very difficult for you to understand that and this concept is obviously one of those where without me actually showing you um you won't believe it because you're so it's so ingrained in your psyche your psychology or your um you know dna uh not necessarily dna but it's ingrained within your sort of understanding observation um uh skill set that you've built up over years because everything you've been told about markets is this notion of things being cheap and expensive at price points um so unfortunately i'm going to have to break that all apart but believe me it's good for you because um it's going to help you to stop approaching the market for the rest of your life in the wrong way and start approaching the right way but before we get into that so let me explain to you why at every price point is 50 50 and it comes back to this thing i was talking about um you might think i've gone off topic but i haven't um as i said before everything i say to you yeah you might think i'm waffling on and probably some of it is you know me just having some musings but 99 percent of what i'm going on and on and on about i'm telling you because it's actually relevant although you may not see it right now so anyway so this supply being dominant factor it comes back to this point so what i've done is i've split up things in terms of factors and then i'm going to compare them to i'll put here financial assets but actually it's i'm going to put here spec because this relates more to speculative markets that have a liquid marketplace so that's anything fx commodities equities because someone could in theory and they'd be right to argue with me and say hang on a savings account is a financial asset yeah it is but obviously it's not a traded um at least not in a liquid marketplace um you'd be surprised the things that obviously banks do structure products up things like savings accounts and they do trade them but the point is in terms of the liquid marketplace i'm talking about when i say financial assets i'm going to compare it to non-financial assets so obviously here these are going to be um i'm not going to spell it out but bread milk um webcams chocolates uh property and so on and so forth so what it is is these are um essentially you know don't think i mean i probably could have been better with my headings where i put financial asset non-financial asset or what it is is i'm just trying to differentiate between financial markets liquid marketplace that you see on your screen as a speculative market and more of these traditional everyday markets that you participate in um as part of your daily life so things like you know buying bread buying milk buying a webcam buying um obviously there's a mouse here buying coffee cups buying um what have i got here in my room books um i've got a jacket here i've got mobile phone i've got a radiator i've got the list goes on but you get my point fridges whatever what you have to understand and i've said this before is there is no difference between you buying pound dollar and you buying a fridge and you buying a coffee cup and you buying a speaker and you buying a computer and you buying a keyboard it is an asset it has value and you can in theory sell it okay you have to understand this there is absolutely no difference and therefore to a large extent the marketplaces they function identically as i showed you in the last part part one ultra market theory that was the whole point of ultra market theory part one to so you can understand there's very little difference theoretically between these marketplaces however in practice when we actually get down to it of course there's differences in the way they function in the sense of structurally so this is where you really have to understand and take your understanding of this concept that i described before um to the next level and look you don't need you don't really need to believe me or take my word for it i've already showed you on a depth of market and just go out in the marketplace and i even showed you before what do you think amazon are doing they're on the offer side of the depth of market on every single product on their website what do you think tesco are doing they're sitting on the offer side of the bread market right and what are you doing you're placing market orders when you go into tesco it's exactly the same someone out there is offering you pounds what are you doing you're buying them obviously there's the added complication here of it being a two-way market and i'm that's you know these small um factors is the whole point of this where we're now going to take a deeper dive and actually look at more specifics of this concept of um and it's not even concept it's the reality of how markets in general are slightly different in terms of obviously speculative financial markets so let's go through the list so we can actually come back to this point about pricing 50 50 at every price point um so that's going to be the easiest way if i take you through these things and we kind of go together and look at the differences between these traditional markets and obviously speculative markets which at its core is the same so supply is dominant now i talked about this before but we're going to talk about it again um with the webcam so i'm using webcams because i don't want to just stick to the same examples i want to show you it doesn't matter milk bread webcams are so random let's talk about webcams so i can show you it applies to everything so we said i'm sorry i've put this in the bid column haven't i get this in the price column so we said 100 pounds you know typically could be the webcam price but let me put a few prices here 103 104 so you see these columns and again as i said before let's not worry about bids uh the bid side of the column let's just concentrate here it doesn't matter we're talking about supply and demand right supply demand okay um let's not complicate it by using all four columns just to obviously prove the point because it doesn't matter whether we use four or two um would you agree that and again i know i talked about this before what is amazon actually doing or or tesco bread or whatever supermarket milk or your corner shop or whoever what are they actually doing when they um participate in the marketplace and put things on their website can you see all they're doing is they've bought so they might have bought 100 pounds what are they doing immediately i don't know let's say they've got 10 000 units can you see what they're doing they're buying at 100 and they're offering it out immediately at 105 would you agree yeah so do you remember the banana market example now look i did this so long ago um and my memories unfortunately deserted me slightly but um i can't remember if it was 11 dollars forgive me if it was 10 but let's just say it was 11 dollars someone in the banana market you know you bought it at 11 what did they do they offered it out at 12 to try and take the tick or whatever it was what do you think amazon are doing they're doing exactly the same thing they're buying webcams from logitech or whoever the manufacturer is at 100 and what they're doing they're offering it out 105 right but what you've got to understand is that they are essentially the entire supply column i understand there's other people offering cameras but generally in everyday goods and services it's incredibly inefficient okay the way that these markets work and that presents profit opportunities because what happens is pockets of inventory are distorted they're sitting in warehouses at individual companies aren't they do you see this issue doesn't exist in the financial marketplace why is that you've got an exchange you've got a depth of market you can see everyone who wants to sell can quite easily come on a platform structurally it's very different so you have to understand this concept of why inefficiencies that exist in everyday goods and services simply don't exist in a financial marketplace so let's come let's we'll come back to that point let's again really hammer this point home about supply being dominant so let's prove it to ourselves so you now agree with me amazon is on the webcam depth of market right so let's get rid of crude oil and put webcam here so they've offered out 105 how can this price move to 106 and you know i'm going to skip a few pricing but 110 what can cause this price to go from 105 pound for a webcam to 106 you know this as i said before it was a rhetorical question market orders can come in but can you see it doesn't work like that in the webcam market because because if amazon really wanted to do you agree they could decide do you know what we've got 10,000 units in our warehouse which we're offering out we don't want to offer those at 105 anymore we decided now to offer those 10,000 units at 110 what's just happened to the price right it's moved up to 110 now this is obviously an extreme example but because normally obviously some people would be buying at 105 but in theory can you see not a single market order took place there yet the price still moved to 110 why is that supply sorry i scribbled that but supply is the dominant factor suppliers are setting the price don't get me wrong i'm not saying that demand doesn't matter of course it does and in some markets demand is going to be you know 50 50 it depends on the market place and how concentrated inventory is amongst big players obviously in cartels as you know oil cartels you've heard of these things where collusion takes place where there's very few players the more of that going on obviously the more price can be manipulated and set by people who are supplying but you've got to understand that on the depth of market in the majority of goods and services suppliers are dominant which creates profit opportunities um so it's moved up from 100 to 110 and obviously as i said it's the supply side now so hopefully you agree here supply is dominant but how is that different here in the speculative market so this is why i hope you can understand i had you on the depth of market for so long because if i hadn't honestly you'd be completely lost if i was trying to explain this to you without you being on a depth of market so we just said the price can jump from 105 right to 110 because the supplier just decided what well that's where they're going to set the price now again i'm going to repeat the point don't misunderstand me i did say in the last section and it's true of course amazon tesco whoever it is are going to be looking at market orders and deciding whether it actually makes logical sense to do that of course they are so i'm not saying supply is the only issue oh sorry the only factor of course demand matters but my point is in a normal financial market that you see on your screen can you see what's actually happening let's say 100 pounds logitech was actually traded on a financial market what you'd actually find is firstly and i talk about it here prices um so it brings me on to my next point would you agree the increments in financial markets are very very tiny so literally what you'd have is the price would be going from a hundred pound uh sorry let me just give me a chance to draw these in five six guys we just talked about the price moving up five pounds you'd be lucky if this traded in a financial marketplace for webcams to go up one p in the way that amazon decided because what amazon will find is so let's say um um and in fact i'm sorry what i'm going to do is i'm sorry about this let's just to make it exactly equal because i did say the price moved from 105 pounds let's actually make this 105 so 100 pounds is there let's have 100 pounds and then 105 but obviously before we were jumping from 105 upwards right to 110 let's say it's 105 oh one just so i can make it equivalent to what i was showing you before 105 02 105 03 04 05 06 07 and so on and so forth right so can you see what's actually happening here in the financial market the price increments are very liquid it's literally like amazon having say they've got their 10 000 units here they won't be able to go up to 110 for example will they why not because there's going to be people offering webcams and forgive me i couldn't it should actually be in that column as you know those are the legacy ones from the weekend there's going to be people doing what guys you've seen the depth of market on their offers at every price level how on earth if amazon decide oh we're going to move the price up from 105 to 110 what's going to happen someone else is going to replace them and anyway good luck because there's someone at 105 and 1p are you going to then go and buy at 110 when you could go into your depth of market click buy at 105.01 course not you're going to buy at 105.01 if amazon decide they no longer want to offer this at 105 would you agree you're just going to go and get buy it from someone else can you see why in financial markets you've got to understand this the competition is incredible it's incredible it's so liquid this marketplace that profit opportunities for suppliers just simply do not exist in the same way they do in the real world because there's just so many of them right it's so competitive you wouldn't believe that it almost makes jumps from one price to the other redundant it is literally why is that because why do you think people are making money every time you see these guys on the high street selling tvs doing whatever they're doing it's because inefficiencies exist between prices would you agree right amazon can obviously move their price up they might have bought 100 and sell at 105 or they can cause this price to jump and there can almost be profit opportunities between buying and selling prices of five pounds six pounds seven pounds you've got to understand in the financial market is so incredibly competitive that on the supply side there's just supplies everywhere they're everywhere you can't even turn around without there being just in your face all the time don't take my word for it look at the supply on your depth of market it's just always there so in terms of actually creating profit opportunities to really hammer this home can you imagine if amazon um are trying to make money right and they've got this uh so let's let's change it up a bit let's say they're trying to let's say they buy at 105 pounds and um that's their cost price right and they decide that they offer at 110 pounds right now imagine in a millisecond they turn around and someone comes in at 105 pound and a penny 1p profit that you have people don't understand this is what is going on in the financial markets they just don't get it it's just unbelievable that people are trading something they do not understand what a beast this thing is how efficient this thing is every single second at every single price point at the most minute increments there's competition right you simply have to understand this concept that at every single price point imaginable um there's competition because that arbitrage opportunity or profit opportunity is being closed the minute you turn around it's being closed it's being closed right you've seen it yourself every single price point those opportunities that you see in real life they simply don't exist and people just don't get this simple concept and it's to do with this 50 50 you know at the end of the day price at any point it's already at its um sort of where it's at its most efficient point because the point is what happens if you think about it when you go on ebay right there's this disconnect between um supply and demand in the sense that suppliers will be able to buy things and you know you might set up an ebay business and you see this opportunity where i don't know you can import something from china cheap and sell it on ebay right so let's say you're getting these webcams for 105 and you can sell them for 110 and basically try doing this and what you will find is very quickly initially you might be one of the only people in the marketplace in efficiencies right in liquidity that's what it is that liquidity doesn't exist so the profit opportunity is there so you can make your fiver on your webcam or whatever you're making try doing this what you'll find is over a period of time say a few months it could be a few weeks um i know i've tried this you know just in my spare time for fun a few years ago i thought let me see what this ebay lark is all about and it's unbelievable i saw this small profit opportunity where i saw some um and actually i'll be honest with you it was nature valley bars i saw them on offer somewhere in um i think it was costco or somewhere and i thought oh i can buy this and i can sell it on ebay for a certain price and there was a little bit of opportunity in that guys as soon as i started doing this i'm not joking within a few days the market got flooded with nature valley bars so many people started coming in and my profit and what happened to the selling price it went down as in the price i could actually achieve on it and my profit opportunity just vanished and it this took place over a few days obviously it can take a few weeks what you have to understand is this process right and many of you have businesses recognize this you're not going to be the only person in the marketplace in most goods and services out there especially things that are more liquid right um things like bread and um whatever it is webcams and things property is a little bit different because it's quite um illiquid in terms of the scale right the more you get towards liquid products i.e easily available and anyone can come into the marketplace in terms of barriers to entry would you agree competition's fierce that profit opportunity's being closed that gap between you know 100 to 105 or 105 to 110 in this webcam market being closed my nature valley example bars these um health bars that i was think i was able to get them for six pound a box in costco and i was selling them for 10 pounds on ebay and i don't know for whatever reason market forces people saw this that i was undercutting them all of a sudden you know the marketplace on ebay was 15 pounds and i was able to sell for 10 pounds and undercut the prices just moved to 10 pounds so quickly i couldn't believe it i almost got left with stock and to be honest i made a loss on the whole thing not a loss but i didn't come out of it with much profit or no profit or whatever the i think there was basically peanuts in it when i considered my obviously time spent and transportation costs buying this stuff and all of that and then posting it to people and by the end of it i think i was lucky to break even but here's the point you've got to realize this process that is happening in the real world where profit opportunities are being closed inefficiencies in the financial market is happening in an instant you know you have no idea what you're up against and why all these people telling you um ah the market's cheap the market the market isn't cheap i'm sorry to burst your entire thinking and way of thinking but you've got to understand at no point price point is the market cheap or expensive it isn't it's just that's it it is the right price okay and i hope you can see this because um i just finally to really bring this home to you and the reason for that is this what i was saying to you at every single increment there are sellers okay every single increment you have to understand that at every single increment can you imagine trying to compete in the webcam market when your cost is 105 pounds there's sellers at 105 pound and a penny and you think all right they get cleared out guys as soon as they're cleared out there's people at 2p 105 pound and 2p you'd be lucky to make 2p and you bought it for 105 quid 3p 4p 5p every single price you look at oh my it's overwhelming how many suppliers there are okay can you see the challenge you're facing if you're gonna view this market as being um cheap or expensive at individual price points you're gonna get yourself into a big muddle and so you gotta snap out of this way of thinking and you know this was really that incredible turning point for me because i realized wow this is what that guy the market wizards guy that i was um you know who never gave me two minutes of his time was trying to tell me this concept that at every single price on a depth of market there isn't really at an individual price point any profit opportunity because the market is so efficient it's closing that opportunity that exists in the real world boom that profit opportunity is being closed because there is fierce competition okay um so just to make sure you get the point again i just apologize for repeating it over and over but it's so important because i wish someone had literally spent a day just repeating this point over and over on a record because it would have saved me a lot of um stagnation really and just being average for a long period of time until obviously i've got this concept so the final time um let's just repeat this but with a different example you know let's say you're in the property market and um you see an opportunity right you buy this product or sorry this house for four hundred thousand and you offer it for five hundred thousand why is that because you see in the marketplace um that that's the fair value right or you perceive that to be the fair value five hundred thousand so there's a depth of market isn't there bids offers bid you know you bought it at four hundred thousand you're offering it at five hundred thousand what the financial marketplace does is is ruthless what it will do is it creates structurally a very easy marketplace for anyone from the comfort of their own home institutions whatever to come into this property marketplace that you you you're um participating in and to be able to come in and put in offers at four hundred thousand and a penny four hundred thousand and two p four hundred thousand and three p guys you're dreaming you think you're going to be able to offer and sell this at five hundred thousand and make your hundred grand be lucky to make one p you think i'm exaggerating go and look at your depth of market right the thing is the reasons why these um pricing opportunities exist in the real market with property where you can make a hundred thousand even five thousand ten thousand um you know a hoover a webcam i'm trying to diversify with examples so you see it's not only one item it's because of this concept we talked about before where supply can be dominant prices are illiquid inefficiency in pricing um and this final concept is time so i've what what it is is i'll pause there for a second because what i've done is i've really concentrated more on um you know the fact that obviously supply tends to be more in charge in these other markets whereas and there's less of it and it's concentrated in a few hands whereas financial markets the competition as i keep saying at every single price level it's it's insane you just can't imagine right and it actually is worse and i'm sorry i'm gonna have to really um so if you're sitting there thinking wow it's virtually impossible for me to make money in this marketplace the way i've been approaching it yeah that's good if you're thinking that because that means you've got what i'm trying to tell you but it's worse i'm sorry i'm gonna make it even worse for you because what you don't understand is this concept of time um because structurally the financial marketplace is so liquid what it's allowed um things to do is that process of where we talked about you know um competition coming in and closing profit opportunities where you know obviously i told you of my health bars i bought them for a um five or six pound and obviously i was trying to sell them out for 10 pounds or whatever it was and that profit opportunity got closed very quickly if you think about it structurally um and i'm going to show you this in terms of time um how do you think um or how does it actually work in a normal marketplace so probably the best thing is if we draw how we see the chart right so you've got price right we're all in agreement and you've got time so the time concept now what we can do is and let me try and um i'm sorry i know this is going on for um a period of time but cannot stress to you how important you have to start understanding this is so we can so i can really start moving it towards a different way of identifying opportunities in the market so if we split out time into time periods right so time is zero time is one two three right maybe four and these are days okay and this is the webcam market okay and you've got your um your little quantity here as well which is measuring market orders right now obviously that hasn't formed yet if you think about it that's forming as things happen but let's think of this in terms of the webcam market okay so we just agreed amazon have decided at 105 pounds they're going to be setting the price in the webcam market right so i'm really going to have to show you just how bad you've got it um and don't get me wrong this is actually good in terms of a marketplace being liquid is obviously very good because it's efficient but it just means the profit opportunities at individual price levels are just zero so would you agree that amazon is going to be setting the price in the webcam market right so i'm so would you agree that amazon on day one as we said they've decided okay we're going to set 105 pounds typically you know bread market obviously webcam market typically um would you agree if you walk into tesco's at the start of the day you know if it's a pound a loaf of bread it's not going to be jumping up and down like a yo-yo um throughout the day is it you know if you're looking at your shelf and there's bread there and it's a pound you're not going to turn around it's one pound one p or you pick something up off the floor one pound two p guys it doesn't work like that in real life does it why is that because of this inefficiency right structural inefficiency is very difficult for tesco to change their price and they wouldn't want to because they need certainty if they bought for 95p a loaf of bread and they're selling it for a pound how on earth are they going to be able to predict any sort of profits or make any money if the price is jumping up and down every second it doesn't right same thing in the webcam market if the price was every time amazon um bought say for 100 pounds and they're trying to sell this thing for 105 they turn around and suddenly the price has changed you're not going to be able to conduct business are you so typically in the real world would you agree how does it work and again supplier dominance would you agree that amazon will say right it's been a day let's have a look at the data you know as i explained to you in the last example let's make it and you saw it where i showed you that price chart we looked at price over four years right on a day-to-day basis it doesn't um or minute to minute it doesn't fluctuate it's fluctuating over time so typically they're going to say let's keep it the same 105 right then day two goes past and they're going to say let's make it well let's make it 106 today based on incoming market orders that we've seen and supply factors whatever then this day they might say um let's keep it 106 again i'm making these numbers up then fourth day they'll say 105 right so the price is changing very slowly right which presents profit opportunities because if they're able to buy this at 100 they can offer it at 105 knowing that typically that profit opportunity is going to be there now don't get me wrong obviously over time it changes but can you see this is what's also happening in i talk about property because everyone's aware of it if you're buying property for 400 000 and i don't know you just need to touch it up and you realize the market value is 500 000 would you agree if it's going to take you a month obviously you've got financing costs and some costs to be able to predict this you do your forecasting your pnl forecast pnl or returns that you might make on this property project guys at the end of the day you kind of know that okay as long as nothing major happens in the market i can sell this in a month's time at 500 000 what you're not understanding when you're looking at the financial markets is they ain't gonna let you have that benefit of time okay to be able to make this profit opportunity that you think that exists it simply doesn't the market is so efficient i cannot tell you it's an incredible machine because of the number of participants and supply at every single level that what you got to understand is this opportunity that exists right where i talked about and i know i keep interchanging but i'm doing that intentionally because i don't want to just keep it about one product i want you to see it's exactly the same everywhere that opportunity that exists for amazon to say all right we bought it for 100 today we know tomorrow we're probably going to be able to make five pound in two days we might be able to make roughly the same property to some extent obviously as well you know that as long as you get things done in a timely manner and there isn't significant shifts you're gonna be able to make a hundred thousand eighty thousand whatever you've got a bit of a buffer because of this element of time gotta understand just simply market is so efficient what it's doing is it's closing profit profit opportunities by the second every second right if these are seconds i can't even draw enough and you don't need me go and look at your dome does it stay static for a day no it doesn't what's happening it's going like this every single second of every single day it's closing any of these inefficiencies that exist and it's incredible how it does it right that's what it's doing throughout the day and sorry i'm gonna it's a very bad drawing of a chart but you get the point this is what the chart is right go and open up your chart what do you think it's doing it's doing this throughout the day right it might go up it might and then it come down and then it but essentially that is what is happening so this process of amazon going process of amazon going from 105 pound on day zero to 105 pound on day one to 106 pound on day two you see this entire four-day process it's basically happened in the gap of four seconds two seconds three seconds i cannot explain to you at individual price levels this thing is an machine it is finding buyers and sellers and matching them and closing any opportunities that exist that you think existed um so like i said in this property example you bought it for 400 000 before you even had a chance to pick up a paintbrush or even get the keys or even you know make speak to lawyers or whatever solicitors to exchange this price has gone from 500 000 to 400 000 and a penny gone why because other suppliers are stepping in at every single price level you just have to understand this concept of um how efficient this thing is at individual price levels so um my point is you need to change your way of thinking you need to stop opening your chart and thinking oh look price is cheap price is expensive at this individual price level guys it isn't you have to start to understand that at every individual price on your platform the profit opportunity is 50 50 it's at best 50 50 because any profit opportunity you think you had is being closed by the market so what does that mean give up no it doesn't so what it is is i've realized over my career as i moved away from um depth of market is because i was so concentrated on the incremental price levels um and there were opportunities on supply obviously as you saw i was reading supply with in terms of spoofing and you know all the game playing that was going on um those opportunities themselves because of fierce competition algorithms coming in see they started disappearing as well so not only was the market efficient it became it's become even more efficient over time as i said structural things because um you've got platforms now you could in theory buy up the entire supply world supply of oil futures contracts if you had enough money at the click of a button could you buy up the entire world supply of property at the click of a button no it would be a slow process you'd have to negotiate you'd have to can you see it's very inefficient this creates opportunities you couldn't buy up the whole supply of webcams of the world supply of webcams or bread at the click of a button because structurally it doesn't exist so i had i realized um as i obviously progressed my career that i was gonna have to um you know as i started moving more towards looking away from the depth of market and trying to figure out okay how can i um broaden my perspective and really understand markets for what they are in a sort of bird's eye view and obviously i saw these indicators and literally i've never even entertained the thought because obviously i knew having spent time in the depth of market they're all garbage but i did recognize this um what i've shown you on this table and um it was this so i started to look at the advantages and disadvantages of me participating in a financial marketplace speculative marketplace and obviously i thought about shall i go into business and shall i go into the hoover business shall i go into the this business that business i wasn't hoovers but you know i had some opportunities and i started this is what got me thinking that actually the two marketplaces are the same but what's the advantages and disadvantages and how can i close the gap so i realized do you know what because of the um abundance of supply and supply always being there demand is obviously much more dominant right you know as you've seen supply is always going to be there it's not really changing the market in a financial market in the way that it does in with products and services because those um there's always supply at every level it's market orders as i already talked about in the last um section so i thought that's a big bonus i don't need to focus on supply staring at supply on the depth of market the way i used to i can drop that and i can just look at volume profile obviously i've been looking at volume profile all the time because i had it my depth of market but i realized i could move the volume profile onto my chart right so that was one big thing because volume profile is just as you know demand and i thought great i don't need to look at supply anymore it's kind of redundant don't get me wrong i'm not saying supply doesn't matter that's why i've put 95% here not 100% look i'm not naive i know that obviously supply can have a very small impact but why even bother spending my day looking at it when it's so minuscule there's always an abundance of supply you may not know banks and exchanges and they have banks have obligations to provide liquidity to the marketplace and you know a lot of people who want to be members of exchanges and things they have obligations to provide obviously liquidity and in return they get obviously reduced costs and things and there's a whole thing liquidity is always going to be there is my point in the way it isn't so point is this was a big tick in the box but as i've already explained to you prices were a problem right because i recognize this having watched the depth of market for so long that all right you know in the same way you can buy a webcam at 100 pound and sell it for 105 pound or property at 400,000 and sell it for 500,000 it just simply that opportunity doesn't exist and that was the whole point of this whole thing as you can see right and i'm sure you agree doesn't exist because of this problem of price increments and so much supply being abundant the competition basically at every price is insane so i've realized that this is a problem but is there anything i can do about it can i say mr market and forgive me i'm not trying to talk to you like you know you're a child or anything i'm just saying this so i can really make you understand i hope you see it's for your benefit um you know i'm not i'm not trying to patronize anyone it's just my way of really trying to hammer the point home is that you can't turn around to the market and say oh can you do me a favor can you stop um transacting at such incremental levels so obviously pound dollar would be you know let's say it's at 131.50 and then 131.51 do you mind not going to four decimal places it's making it difficult for me to make money again obviously it's laughable right it's not gonna happen so it's something we just gotta accept and deal with that in the real world where inefficiencies exist and we can make profit from 100 pounds to jump to 105 pounds simply doesn't exist in the market so we just have to accept that we've got this problem deal with it stop trying to find an indicator that's going to get rid of this problem and that's what people are doing stop listening to all this garbage out there that at individual price levels things are cheap and expensive they're not every single price level is already maximum efficiency why because of this issue another problem i recognized was typically in the real world you know if you're going to set up a hairdressing shop or a personal training shop or a gym you're typically on the offer side right it's easier because you're selling and someone's buying right unless obviously there are wholesale markets out there but typically 90% of the time if you want to go out and set up your own business a service you're providing it consultancy what are you doing you're on the offer side of the it consultancy depth of market someone comes in hits them oh god it's typically one way right if you're going to make it in this business you need to do this it's like a business plan and recognize got a major disadvantage because there's two ways and that's the problem because you're no longer just on the offer side you're dealing with people on the bid side and can you see you've got incredible competition now on the bid side as well wow it's you know it's incredible this market is it's and i'm even a little bit speechless because i haven't thought about it for so long because obviously i haven't had to teach anyone this theory for a long time you know it's just i've kind of um understood this concept many years ago and i've just been applying it every day without even thinking about it to me it's like oh yeah but obviously now just it's taking me back a bit as well and reminding me just how amazing this you've got to have a lot of respect for this marketplace and um coming back to the point sorry i went a bit off topic though a bit about being two-way is what can you do about it can you say to the market look do you mind shutting down the bid column it's too difficult for me i just want to be how a normal marketplace is i just want to be able to buy something but then only offer it out no it's not going to work is it it's going to be an incredibly efficient two-way market whether you like it or not why is that competition guys got to understand the competition in financial markets is more fierce than in any marketplace in the entire planet and until you start this is why i said about having respect can you see on social media and it doesn't wind me up i just sit back and laugh because i see these people got zero chance of making it because firstly they ain't got a clue about the stuff i've been telling you on this slide but more importantly than that they ain't got they don't have respect for what this marketplace actually is and until you start respecting that every single individual price point the market's already priced in then you're going to be in trouble so we can't do anything about this two-way thing right can you see what is left time that's the only option left and this is what dawned on me wasn't necessarily over one day but obviously as i developed my own understanding of volume profile on a chart um it started to dawn on me okay right here's something that maybe i can close the gap between what's going on in the real world and what's going on in the financial marketplace i realized is the only hope i had because these other things as you can see um you know in terms of the market being so efficient at individual market uh price points i realized there was no profit opportunity i just stopped thinking about this cheap expensive stuff at individual price points and i know it's taken me a while to come to this point and guys this is where it all changed for me i cannot stress this enough you've got to move away from being obsessed about thinking of the market in terms of individual prices and you've got to start thinking about value why is that so when i say bridge the gap what do i mean exactly how can i get to the stage where i can be an amazon and actually start thinking of the market the way they do or tesco does or anyone does right do you agree they're able to actually do analysis or even make profits because they're able to have some concept of what value is in terms of what they're selling over a decent amount of time so my point is right they're able to basically say for the day that's the price 105 and then obviously it changes to um i can't remember what i wrote i think i wrote 106 or uh could have been 105 again i think it's 105 um anyway it's irrelevant you see the point it's gone to 106 then it's gone to 106 then it's gone to 105 can you see i needed to stop i needed to i realized i needed to just it was driving me insane i needed to stop thinking of the market the way everyone does that oh it's cheap here it's expensive at this price and no nonsense i had to just stop thinking of the market in terms of these individual prices because what you see as i've said already this 105 here this 106 here this 106 that is happening there at these individual prices right it's so incremental that i realized what i needed to do is i needed to figure out a way of bridging this gap between how the webcam market the bread market or whatever is at these prices how can i basically encompass all of this action into sort of a value for the day now the problem is that you see in the real world obviously you can have it 105 pounds at any moment not in time but almost over a day or two days or a month it's very static prices are so it's quite easy for us to think of value as an individual price but as you've seen in financial markets they're closing those gaps so quickly that almost for us to equate what's happening over a day can you see we're not going to ever be able to really get it to a one specific price what we're gonna have to do is so let me just so no one gets confused this is very clear in my head and i want to make sure it comes out onto the screen in the right way what we're essentially aiming to do is get as close as possible can you see realistically because the market's obviously so different and it's moving up and down like a yo-yo all day long um and actually isn't what it's doing you don't realize the market at every single second all it's doing it's just closing inefficiencies closing inefficiencies closing inefficiencies and the effect of that is this thing that you see on your chart zooming up and down it's meaningless guys all these zigzagging that you see doesn't mean anything people people are trying to see opportunity in that there isn't you don't realize that's just the effect you've got to realize cause and effect the cause is the market is closing inefficiencies as i've shown you on the depth of market at all times so we've got to move away from individual price and start thinking about how can we actually get close to value how can we bridge this gap between what real businesses in the real world are somehow able to sort of define as value how can we bridge this gap so and i know i keep repeating the point it's because i really want you to understand what we're aiming to do is we're almost trying to get as close as we can on even keel to this price can you see this 106 change this 105 change we're trying to and i've drawn a little bit of a range because i'm saying it's as close as we can because we're never going to be able to look we have to accept the reality that the price does fluctuate over the day but how can we actually close that gap and get as close to some semblance of sort of otherwise what you're doing is you're trying to grab thin air all the time how can we get close to some semblance of where should i be you know where's value where is this thing because otherwise all you're going to be doing with these indicators and trying to or even thinking in terms of individual price points being cheap or expensive is you're always going to be trying and grabbing thin air there's too much competition and it's it's it's already at a fair price at individual levels but over time what's happening is what you can do and obviously this is using so i'm getting to the point now the way we do it is we use transactional data right what we've got is we've got market orders it's great we have what amazon tesco's all these guys have now using volume profile using individual transactions what we've now got is we've got a rough idea of approximately right so i need to clear some of this because it is a bit messy i'm going to move this 105 but just remember it is 105 it's going to make it easier for me how can we get as close to that price that all these businesses are able to have some certainty over is essentially by using the profile so what this is called is called value basically and it's a term that is used by market professionals that use volume profile and essentially that's pretty much every institution in the world right go and google it the VWAP which i'm going to talk about in a little while is value volume weighted average price it's basically value it's a measure of value every single institution bank whatever you can think of in the world that's how they're measuring this 105 this 106 this 106 because otherwise how do you do business you can't do business if the market is moving up and down like a yo-yo unless you have some way of grabbing it and saying right come here this is where in any given moment in time it's not exact by any means but it's an approximation for what businesses are doing every day coming up with some concept of what value is okay so you've got to understand it's no longer about these individual prices that you're seeing and this is unique to financial marketplaces is especially on a short horizon right obviously businesses would have to do this if they're trying to forecast for the next year two years because in on that basis as soon as you start going out further um in time you see as i showed you on that website prices do behave like this don't they they do go up and down you saw the webcams you saw the chocolates Cadbury's chocolates and whatever over longer periods of time even they are having to do what look at value that's why in the last section we were doing what saying that you know there was this this sort of notion of value area but i'm saying to you it's so bad um in terms of or you could argue good for you know efficiency um in terms of liquidity etc it's a very efficient marketplace but for profit opportunities it's so bad that is that process that you see happening over many weeks and months in normal markets because it's happening second by second and profit opportunities are being closed every moment on a depth of market we have to step away and say okay how can we actually get to some sort of approximation of this 105 this 106 this pound that you see bread being sold for how can we get as close to that as we can okay guys so the closest we can get to that is by using transactional data and looking and seeing approximately where did the majority of transactions take place okay do you see this because it's not an indicator it's real life if i showed you this already we talked about in the milk example um if the majority of transactions take place between you know 140 and 160 and Tesco or whoever it is these people that sell milk they're trying to figure out where's the fair price of milk guys am I going to look at a Fibonacci and say nah let me look at the 50% nonsense it's going to be where the transactions took place right the answer is in front of you and I've said this before when you're using all that junk you're not understanding you're covering all this stuff up you've got to look at transactional data um and you know my job's a lot easier because you it's just common sense isn't it obviously the fair price is where transactions are taking place so we're pretty much done but my point is again and I noticed this being done even by so again look I'd ask that you don't necessarily put any of this on a public forum not because it's a secret but because I've never seen this out there I've deduced this myself um but here's my final point and it comes back to did you notice how I said fair price I've even noticed people when they're looking at volume profile and doing all this stuff they're obsessed they keep falling into this trap and I think this is why even in institutions the success rate isn't very high and people using institutional tools is absolutely crucial you've got to understand there is no fair price can you see that there's no individual price for the reasons that I keep mentioning people as I show you when we go through the theory of identifying value using some statistical techniques we're going to be able to actually identify exactly where these lines should go to obviously give us an idea of what value is people tend to get so specific about prices and you have to understand there's no fair price it's it's a range of prices it's value essentially this whole area okay is as close as you're ever going to get to what businesses in the real world can say you know is 105 pound or 106 pounds or whatever this value is you've got to understand that the market simply doesn't ever have this specific price it kind of has a value in terms of why is that well if you think about it on any given day transactions are taking place at so many price levels we say approximately the majority took place between I don't know say a 10 pick range isn't it so that's going to be your fair value so this is what I talked about in the reality check where I said you've got to give the market wiggle room and people find this concept very hard to really understand is about this wiggle room thing and I hope you can understand why it took so long to explain this to you because you've got to understand fair value is not one point it's basically this is fair value the whole thing is fair value okay and that's the wiggle room I talked about and really it was such a liberating feeling for me when I realized I could come into the market and actually start to see the market as a range of prices being equivalent to this one pound or whatever you see out in the marketplace and it will present profit opportunities because you get this gyrations obviously happening around where the bulk of transactions take place so you know with the volume profile it does present certain profit opportunities but we're going to talk about that and then we're going to go on actually next to talk about balance versus imbalance because don't forget obviously I've shown you a perfect market here where over one day the market transactions are taking place what in a nice little confined area you know that's not the case right in so let's just get rid of everything because we're done in the real marketplace right what's actually happening if you think about it you've got price and then you've got time is unfortunately you're going to get this kind of thing happening where the market will be balanced like this sorry that was completely wrong because I wanted these to be days or weeks or months or whatever the market's going to be doing this and then it's going to shift and then it's going to start balancing here and then it's going to shift and it's going to start balancing here so even sometimes in a day you can have volume profiles that will look like this and then you'll have this and then you'll have very bad drawing it won't always be you know like how it is on a day like this where it's very smooth volume profile and a balanced market can you see why I got you on the depth of market because you've seen this this isn't a new concept to you it's just what you see on your depth of market I've just put it on a chart okay market orders and the volume profile I've just put it on a chart so what you're essentially can you see you've got little profiles here got little balances balances so what the market's doing is it's going from balance and then it's imbalancing and balancing and then it's imbalancing and balancing and imbalancing and you've got to realize this is what the market's doing all day long it's just going from balance to imbalance in value okay not an individual price you couldn't get this out of your head that this garbage where people say oh the market moved from 121.50 to 121.63 or 120 it's all garbage it doesn't mean anything as I've shown you at an individual price level you've got to start moving away from thinking of price moving to another price you've got to start thinking because otherwise what you're doing is you're doing what um you've basically got no profit opportunity as I showed you you've got to start thinking in terms of a concept of value because that's the only way you're going to bridge the gap with how any business in the real world works and somehow in a weird way if you think about you're creating inefficiencies for yourself to take profit from okay by thinking of individual prices you just efficient to efficient to efficient to efficient here what you're doing is you're trying to create inefficiencies by coming out with some sort of measure of approximation of where value is at any given time in the marketplace as I said and I keep sounding like a broke record where this is and you've got to realize that actually the market is doing this all day long it will stay balanced right and then it will go and test another price and you've seen this happen um during very directional markets is and I'm kind of going into the next section but it's kind of I might as well just introduce it here it won't stick around very long and it will just move okay so it's imbalanced it can't find where people want to transact as soon as it comes to a place where people want to start transacting okay it starts to balance again and it's happy so you see this on the volume profile blah blah blah so we'll talk about this in the next section I apologize if that wasn't the best explanation you didn't get it but you know give it a go if you don't get it let me know I understand it's changing the way that you've approached the markets and if you can understand this I can assure you you're going to be in the company of a very few people in the world who actually get that this is what is going on in the marketplace every day I cannot exaggerate that enough I'm not saying that for my own ego you know end of the day I'm happy to share this knowledge as you can see I don't want to keep this to myself this is wonderful through this course I'm having this wonderful opportunity to really share this with other people it's brilliant for me I believe in you know positive karma and all of that and as I said because of this wiggle room where the market's moving around you're never going to get the same price as me you're never going to destroy my age or anything like that because the perfect price doesn't exist I've showed you don't exist the market will close that perfect price opportunity but value opportunities do exist and I want you to see that and that's why I'm happy to share this but again I don't want to say this too many times but appreciate obviously if you exercise discretion and obviously you know use this for your own benefit and you can tell friends about it and stuff but obviously don't get it on the public forums because I'm sure you agree none of this it just doesn't exist people don't have this knowledge and yeah you know I'm happy to be able to share that so hopefully it's been useful to you and my point before again I did go a little bit off track there is if you if you get stuck or anything look don't panic I'm always here to help reach out to me ask me look Envy I didn't understand this you know can you do you mind if we go over it or whatever I'm happy to and do that in a group environment or even if you need to individually fine we can try and find some time but the point is I'm happy you know I love talking about markets as you can see I've pretty much been badgering in the ear for I don't even know how long this has gone on for probably at least an hour or more yeah it's important I say this not talking for the sake of it is that I don't want you to be watching this because a lot of you will be seeing this for the first time and trying to get your head around it and getting confused and I want you to know you know I'm very much here to help you if you don't get it don't panic maybe watch it a few times but at some stage I will be quite frank with you you have to understand that this is how the marketplace works and very very very few people in the world do if you can understand it yeah you're going to increase your chances of success incredibly and hopefully looking at things like this you're going to move away from looking at complete bs like indicators and all they don't tell you anything okay they absolutely don't tell you anything and in fact something came into my mind and it's quite important I'll show this to you you know if you've got a market let's say it goes from here to here and people use this Fibonacci nonsense right let's say the market was at 130 and 120 in pound dollar right and you've that's the Fibonacci there and you've got 50 here I'm going to show you how nonsense this is in terms of trying to determine places to trade and how important transactions are this is really going to open your mind and 50 is 125 right I'm going to show you how meaningless all indicator tools are I mean every single tool throw it in the dustbin because of this reason alone this assumes that the majority of transactions took place at 125 let's say there were 10,000 transactions market orders that took place between 120 and 130 on this given day right there's price there's time one day now what if out of those 10,000 transactions one transaction took place here and 9,999 transactions took place at 130 so basically that was all the transactions and then there was no volume basically why on earth would you be looking at 50% what what on earth is 50% it's nothing would you agree you want to be looking at that area this is the problem with technical analysis guys they're not looking at where the price is right where the value is all transactions are taking place at 9,999 so my point is this if you bought a good right or you were in the business of buying pounds buying a hoover buying whatever and you had this business plan and you were trying to think okay where's the price where can I make money and this was the marketplace and you had this amazing data where you knew 99.99% which is what that is of the marketplace is transacting at 130 would you could would you in your business plan right down let's say you were going for investment and you had investors in front of you and you said to them you know I want some investment I got this product they say prove it to us that you can get this price or that price for it and you say well actually my 50% is at 125 would you do that or would you actually in your business plan say actually the market is buying at 130 so that is where I should be able to sell my product obviously you're going to look at where the market's buying is so obvious so why oh why are people using indicators and saying oh it's that 50% can you see what if one transaction took place there or zero it boggles the mind that people are doing this right so hopefully that makes sense you're going to drop all that nonsense now and you're going to start looking at transactions okay where transactions took place and we're going to now start to hopefully move a little bit away from theory and start to really focus more on financial markets right sorry guys just when you thought it was all over I was actually just reviewing the this section that I've just put together and I thought you know what let me just take this opportunity to really go through that last example I showed you with the Fibonacci really quickly and what it is is I hate editing stuff and cutting stuff out because I want you to see that a lot of everything is just not planned you know I'm trying to give you everything that's in my mind without it being scripted and I just don't believe in doing it that way so and this is for your own benefit so like I said rather than cut that bit out I thought let me just give them like the exact same example with the 120, 125, 130 and the 50% Fibonacci but let me do it in a way that is really going to bring the point home across that I'm trying to think about so and this will take a couple of minutes then we're definitely done but it's really important that you understand this thing about indicators versus you know real transactions that are taking place in the marketplace so we've got two markets here now let's say this is the webcam market right and it's 105 and um 1 I don't know 115 and 125 this is the price right of uh webcams and then over here um for example we've got I don't know 120 um 135 and 150 and you know it doesn't matter don't worry about the increments the point is that could be pound versus dollar and this could be webcams right now my point that I was trying to make before when I was reviewing it and I thought how can I actually show like even more intensely how um by using some of these tools um how off the true path to success you are just how far you are is let's think of this webcam market right so um let's say that um we we've got this data that tells us that um you know over the year for example last year 10,000 webcams were bought but like I said in the previous example 9,999 were bought at 105 zero were bought here and maybe one was bought here so obviously we already know in terms of profile that's going to be thin and then obviously going to get a big bulge here um and then similarly here um in terms of pound dollar there were transactions that took place 9,999 and then zero at 135 and one at 150 you know we're all familiar with pound versus the dollar um so again it's going to be a similar profile so my point is I want to show you one that show you applies to both markets and you know like again come back to the investor scenario and you've got these investors and you want them to invest in the business and you've been able to source these webcams at um 105 pounds right um or whatever the price is but if for this example let's say you've bought them at um 105 pounds or 104.50 or whatever it is so um but you're trying to basically see is there any profit in this marketplace and you've got these investors and obviously if you've ever gone and pitched for investment or watched dragons band shark tank or whatever one of these programs that are very popular um they'll obviously say where's the marketplace where you're going to be able to sell this thing at what's your cost so you know your cost is you know approximately 104.50 or 105 or whatever and you say to them I can sell this thing at 115 and they say to you why and you say well because I don't know over a period of time whatever that may be the price has fluctuated between 105 and 125 and that's 50 percent so I think that basically this is where the price um will ultimately sort of retrace to right so it could be down here for now the market's at 105 as we said amazon but in the past it might have been up here at 125 so you show them this and you say well look I think the market's going to retrace 50 percent and I'll be able to sell it at 115 right and but the entire market transacted at the only reason it ever got to 125 because was one unit was ever sold there in this whole period of time but actually this whole year 9999 units were sold at 105. You've got to ask yourself do you think that those investors are going to give you their money and say oh yeah brilliant the 50 percent is at 115 so you'll be able to make 10 pounds or do you think they're going to say to you hang on a minute 99.9 percent 9999 units of the 10 000 were all sold at 105 you're living in cuckoo land you're going to only be able to sell it at 105 that's what they're going to say to you right well you might say to me yeah that's obvious envy well how come then if you see pound dollar do this right why are you using technical indicators to think that that means anything when it gets to 50 percent do you see no transactions guys you've got to understand that volume in the same way when you're trying to run a business and you're trying to see where market orders demand is you've got to understand that these things moving averages squiggly lines trend lines without knowing where people are willing to buy this thing you're going to waste your entire life chasing thin air i really hope you can see why i had to do this again and if you don't understand this point then that's okay you can obviously keep re-watching this until you do but i'd highly suggest that you stop trading for a little while until you get just how ludicrous it is to use any technical analysis when you've got transactional data in front of you you wouldn't do it if you're pitching for investment you wouldn't do it in any other business and i've just spent the best part of three hours showing you that there's no difference between a trading business and any other business so please stop doing it and yeah just have to make that point but anyway so i'm going to repeat again and say you know thanks for putting up with me throughout this video i hope you found it useful we're now going to move on to balance and imbalance and hopefully that'll be the end of the indicator bashing because you will get it now just how ridiculous and random all these lines and things that you see are firstly for the reasons that i've just spent you know obviously told you for the last hour that individual price points pointless nothing there's no inefficiencies there you're not going to find it and then secondly it's obviously this point that i've told you here and you know the final point i remember i didn't make during the last the whole session was that you've got to remember that there's guys out there with billions of pounds forget millions billions invested trying to look for profit opportunities in incremental price points just forget about it it's not a viable thing for us to do focus on value doing what real businesses in the real world are doing and let's try and bridge that gap between the fluctuations in the final financial market and let's try and bridge that gap and try and somehow find some area of kind of value where we can equate it to what we used to see on the shelves at our supermarket and obviously on amazon it has this kind of value to it let's really try and give it some tangible value by taking advantage of the fact that we can see essentially where transactions have taken place and you can see it's just the market's just giving us the answer market feedback all right so hope that was helpful see you in the next section cheers

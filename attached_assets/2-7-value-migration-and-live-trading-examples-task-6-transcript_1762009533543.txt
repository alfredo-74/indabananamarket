Hello traders, welcome to 2.7. Now this is actually the final, final session of the entire course and I've actually come back after a little while of putting the course together to put this in for you just because obviously I wanted to review the entire course now that I've completed all the sections and I just wanted to find a nice way to cap it off. Obviously I needed a bit of a break as well because as you can see and I hope you appreciate it was a really exhaustive effort to put together what ended up being, you know when I started I thought maybe it would be 10 hours, it ended up being 50 hours and I'm glad I've done that because it means I've left nothing on the table, everything's there. But the most important thing to say right at this stage is you might be wondering, hang on I just finished 2.6 so let me just get the logistics of the course out of the way first. So basically what I want you to do if you've just finished 2.6 which would have been task 4 I believe where you've obviously brought together static and dynamic value and you're developing some basic hypothesis in terms of obviously CVA, DVA and you know starting to look at how developing value and static value come together so you can look for trading opportunities. So what I want you to do now if you've just finished 2.6 is stop this video, don't do 2.7 because this is actually the final video of the course now and it will make complete sense if you now go straight to stage 3 so if you just jump straight to 3.1, shut the video off now, go to 3.1 and do the entire order flow section okay and then come back here and finish off the final video and like I said when you finish stage 3 you'll make complete sense okay so I'm just going to pause for one second and assume that you've gone to stage 3, finished off the whole of stage 3 and what you'll notice is you'll basically be finishing off at 3.2, the cumulative delta section. You work your way through 3, it will all make sense, I'm not going to explain it again here because it will make sense when you get to stage 3. I'm just going to assume you've now finished all of stage 3, you've done the final task which was task 5 which is actually part of the 3.2 cumulative delta section but like I said that will all make sense. I'm just going to assume now you've just finished task 5, you've fired up this last video so now you'll be well aware that I've basically covered everything right so what you've essentially done now is you've got your large part of your context in terms of the CVA part of your hypothesis for the day, static value, multiple, multiple days and it's something I'm going to touch upon actually in this final section, I'll come back to it in a moment. You've got your DVA obviously looking at the VWAP and we did a little bit of obviously VWAP theory in stage 1 as well that's why I've got it down here but we went into much more detail didn't we in stage 2 and that obviously formed part of the tasks that were within stage 2 so I believe there was task 3 and task 4 which you would have done now and obviously that would have gone over the VWAP. We have talked a little bit about volume profile, obviously heavily we discussed it in the foundation course but obviously I've touched upon it throughout the course again in the pro and then you've just finished stage 3 so you've basically done all of the order flow right so basically as you know now your main hypothesis is going to be, excuse me, your main hypothesis for the day is going to be CVA right, DVA and order flow okay so like I said stage 1, terrible drawing stage, sorry let me just do that again I'm a little bit particular I do like it to I look perfect so stage 1 was the CVA agreed stage 2 was DVA and within stage 2 we brought together CVA and DVA and then stage 3 so CVA DVA and then stage 3 was the order flow which I've already got written there and that's basically your hypothesis for the day right and obviously we like I said we ended at 3.2 so look the feedback's been brilliant and I really appreciate it but obviously since I've completed everything I had a chance to obviously review stuff and I thought actually it'd be really nice you know given that so much effort's been put into the course and I've obviously given some live examples in with the footprint order flow stuff and I also gave a live example with the depth of market I actually thought it'd be quite nice to give you some live examples just to finish the entire course off bring everything together and actually show you a couple of live examples where I am trading myself and bringing all of the three components together and we can do a hypothesis and because there were two options right there was one is I could just do a little bit more replay market replay where I bring all the stages together and I kind of already did that in the order flow section if you think about it 3.2 when I was going through cumulative delta I went through a lot of market replay and I was thinking what's the best way should I just bring everything together by doing more market replay actually I think it's quite nice if I show you a live trade so what I managed to do this week and you'll notice the dates are a little bit further on now because obviously I wanted to reflect on the course and not rush kind of this final section take on a bit of feedback see what people wanted to see etc etc so it's really important to me that I had done this final sort of video properly so what I managed to do during the week is I recorded myself doing a couple of live trades which we're going to cover now rather than doing market replay and look I know I've said a lot but the final point is that I want you to do all of this so I guess you could call it kind of the final task is task six where you're very much now everything is being brought together is what I want you to do is I do want you to use the market replay of course and you know start to obviously monitor and measure your performance and so on and so forth but most importantly the point is I've already shown you how to do market replay extensively so I kind of feel like there's no point me going through tons of market replay again you've already seen the functionality I've been through an incredible amount of detail so again it's a nice way to kind of kill two birds in one stone where I bring everything together but in the form of a couple of you know solid live examples so what I'm going to do actually is also I think something I've taken for granted and I realized when I was recording myself is I want to discuss composite value area migration a little bit because it is something that kind of just is a nice icing on the cake obviously we've done a lot of intraday work it's nice to really look at on your same sort of chart book a way of kind of bringing together I guess you could call it higher time frame but just really thinking about what multi-day investors are doing so look that's basically an insight into what to expect in this final module I hope you enjoy it let's just crack on to the next slide and I'll just quickly talk a little bit about value migration and then we'll get on the live examples and then that's it you know I'll leave you to it to really go away and do your own practice okay so value migration I've put together this little slide but actually we're not going to spend more than two three minutes on this slide because what I want to do is I actually want to show you in terms of the composites what I mean by value migration and how it can really help you to kind of add an extra strong building block to that 70 percent of your hypothesis which as I explained in the order flow section is really the biggest part of everything you know the order flow is obviously quite important but you know if you don't have your contextual read correct then you're obviously going to be in trouble so again like I said having reviewed everything I think this is a real nice way just to end the course off and talk a little bit about you know going a little bit full circle in the sense that we started off obviously looking at very microscopic order flow and then I built you up and then we went back to order flow and now just bringing you nicely back to this big overall view and then we'll obviously crack on with the live examples and again bring everything together so hopefully you see it's very nicely structured and allows you to really get a good feel for all the components you'll need as you go off now and kind of explore on your own and really try and bring everything together for yourself and see how I approach things during a kind of real trading day so the CVA bias you could almost think of it as a high time frame bias because if you think about it you know you've got these and again I say it throughout my drawings are terrible but you've got these multiple days right so if you think about it on a static basis the investors who are if you think of the these three combined right so you've done it so many times now where you merge all the profiles together and if you bring it all together if you think about it this could be for example the composite value area it's going to be three days worth so clearly investors that are involved in sort of this area who are driving the market either up or down so they could be driving up they could be driving it down they're going to be guys who are holding for multiple days so clearly they're going to be different types of investors to day traders or algorithms and therefore they're going to have more longer term view of the market so for us to kind of really take that view into account on our existing kind of chart book one of the things I do and you'll see that I do this in the live examples which is why I thought it'd be nice for me to just briefly explain this outside of the live examples and then I'll refer to again when I'm trading the live market is if you think about it value itself and obviously I have discussed this in quite a lot of detail but let's just briefly touch upon what we're talking about here basically if you think of any we've talked about traded goods and services and obviously I've shown you many times that financial markets are the same if you think about how financial markets are kind of developing throughout not only the day but over time you know we've said it many times before that in general what they're doing they're trying to find what we could deem as value right or fair value if you want to fd fair value right and that's typically as we've said you know 70 percent or whatever you want to call it now if you think about it over time right okay you could say they typically prices can get overstretched because we've said things can happen factors you know that you don't necessarily see on your chart we've talked about it with milk and all sorts of goods and services so I'm not going to go over again but we said there can be factors that are determining prices to shift now if those factors normalize what happens we just come back and then we continue and this obviously cva will just get bigger and bigger and bigger but as we've seen you know and this obviously this takes longer to happen in the real world where we see serious fundamental structural shifts right in value and I talked about this in stage one where actually value can move the entire mean of where fair value is can move and then you start to develop balance elsewhere okay so there's two ways of looking at this and this is one thing that I haven't really discussed is that these are all static values right so we can put here static static let me just clean this up a bit I beg your pardon sorry just bear with me whilst I just clear this up right and because you guys are experts at this you know I'm not going to make it all go into incredible amount of detail because you should be able to understand exactly what I mean when I say when they're developing in fact just run out a little bit of space when I'm developing value is forming throughout the day what are we doing we're trading around static value right we're using that to see where were investors kind of satisfied that fair value was before and of course if we are going so if you think about this if we are going imbalanced on any given day now this is so in fact just to get this in chronological order would you agree this volume here relates to the composite there this volume here relates to the composite here so my point is if you think about it if you you know do a breakout value pull back here and you fail to return back to this area you're more than likely going to what go to the next area okay so that's all well and good now what I mean by value migration is it's slightly different okay is this might be an old composite value okay where the market has formed historically in the past so my point is this what I'm not looking at where are we relative to historical static value what I'm actually looking at is the most recent static values how have they moved how have they actually changed so for example has static value shifted up has static value shifted down okay what's actually happened to static value itself how has it migrated has it migrated up has it migrated down the reason why this is so important if you think about it is because this gives us a massive idea of how multi-day investors are shifting so it's a higher time frame bias so so if I just clear this up a little bit just clear some of this up so I can try and make it clear for you and then we're going to get on the charts now this is why I didn't want to spend more than a few minutes because it's more difficult to describe in drawings it's just easy if I kind of explain it to you in a on the chart so for example here we can see that the last two composite value areas okay have shifted up long so multi-day investors are doing what they're moving the market higher so my point is this right if I start to move out of here right my bias in general is going to be not only long based on for example I say the fact that we've broken out of the composite value area right and we're maybe going imbalanced on a developing value area basis I'm also going to have a long bias because composite value area itself is moving upwards does that make sense so actually multi-day investors themselves are moving value upwards they're migrating value to higher levels and therefore my point is if I've got an old kind of level here it's going to give me that much more confidence to go and attack it right because I'm looking behind me and thinking hang on what are current multi-day investors doing so you know what we can do is as I said you know migration can move up down or sideways and so on and so forth because at the end of the day what could happen is we could move up and we could fail and therefore value could kind of stick in this area again and we could start to form more composite value and therefore my bias on a migration basis is going to be what it's going to be more balanced because I'm thinking if you think of this as CVA kind of A then the next one is B and hang on C is here do you see we never the migration upwards failed in a way and then we started building a significant amount of value here in between so it's kind of more sideways had migration sort of happened downwards and then downwards right then obviously I'm going to be having a bias in terms of multi-day investment or investors to the south and the reason why this is important is because if the market let's say I'm here and then that's the previous kind of composite value area and let's say on any given morning I'm here and the market starts to kind of move up I'm going to be very weary right because hang on multi-day investors are moving the market down okay if I'm moving up I'm going to be maybe thinking hang on maybe my bias maybe I should wait for a failure of some sort here and carry on with the value migration with the higher time frame bias in the sense of multi-day investors so that's really important to understand look don't worry I've explained in pictures so I know it can get sometimes a little bit confusing we're going to go into the chart so I'm going to quickly show you that but this is really important the final thing is the exception to this is where we have a huge gap so sometimes as you see here we'll have a big value migration and then we may obviously open miles away from the previous kind of CVA low and you know there you want to kind of either you can fill the gap or you can wait for it to happen you want to kind of wait for that to happen and then go with the migration again so that's the only exception and again we will discuss that so don't worry we'll get on to that so you know rather than confuse matters and do more diagrams and so on and so forth let me show you on obviously the CVA charts on the composite chart and it's going to make a lot of sense all right so let's go crack on and I'll show you on a chart okay traders so as I said we're gonna just quickly have a look at value migration on a market profile chart and you'll see it's honestly it's not very complicated in the sense of actually understanding what value migration is obviously you'll need to spend a few months putting everything together as you develop your skill set of how value is shifting or not shifting and what the market is trying to achieve but this is going to give you a great idea of what multi-day investors are trying to achieve without adding in a ton of extra charts so it will be on your exact same chart book that I gave you in stage three you're just using the existing market profile to give you a really strong kind of high time frame bias of what multi-day investors are doing and I hope you'll see that and that is incredibly powerful just to add this final layup to your 70% when you start your day and do your hypothesis and obviously I will talk about this when I'm doing my live trading examples but rather than do it at the same time I thought it'd be quite nice just for me to very quickly show you what I mean as I try to depict in sort of diagrammatic format but obviously as you'll see it's just really straightforward and as soon as you see on the market profile chart you'll become easier so first things first let's kind of just kick off here and straight away you'll see what I mean so if we merge these two I think you'll agree that there's you know some overlapping value between those two days so let's just have a look at that again there you go okay Friday and coming into sorry Monday and Tuesday okay so if I merge those two and Friday is actually just below that's why you don't see it here it's actually obviously the market's moved up since prior to the weekend but essentially what you've got here is you've got Monday and Tuesday merged together look we don't have any previous composite value area at this stage let's just assume this is you have to start somewhere don't you doing your composites so at the moment we don't know what is value itself actually done so I'm not talking about where you come into your because all this time we've been talking about you know when you come into a new day you've got your kind of line in the sand and obviously the market's trying to go imbalanced etc etc what I'm talking about is what is the actual composite itself trying to do okay so at this stage we've only got one composite so we continue to move there's no clearly our bias is going to be long relative to the CVA what about CVA itself so at the moment we don't know because we don't have another CVA to compare it so now we're just comparing CVAs to each other we're comparing multi-days to multi-days and that gives us an idea of what what multi-day investors are trying to achieve okay so here I would argue there's no sort of composite value area here because they're really separate aren't they I mean look you've got kind of value here you've got value here and then you've kind of got value here and I don't you know personally I'm not too keen to merge those so I won't and then we've got these two days where you could argue here that you've got some decent sort of value building here so my point is that you can really see multi-day investors are trying to push this market up so CVA sorry again I think you all know I like to just be perfect with that so you can see here migration starting to happen value itself as I talked about before you get structural shifts don't you this actual value area itself and I'm not talking about individual days I'm talking about multiple days of value the entire block is shifting up it's important right because this is incredible information you know we've talked about this again and again in stage one where you're trying to always figure out where does the market see fair value and I'm not talking about fair value on single day I'm talking about multiple days of fair value very very strong value where the market thinks it's fair price if that itself is shifting i.e CVA is migrating itself we've got to be aware of that we've got to pay attention to that so and in fact what you'll notice is it's actually solidified in the sense that you start getting this area here and you know you come in you could you'd obviously want to merge this and this right so you get this kind of little and in a way you could argue that this is kind of still um how do I say it migration has actually slowed down a little bit right so this is a really nice example to start off with because first we got value migration so don't forget we're only talking about composites here multi-day investors right so CVA A shifted up became CVA B and then we shifted down CVA C so what's value migration doing right now it's gone from going up to going sideways you know I talked about value migration can be sideways so here it's sideways why is this important because the reason why it's important is because when value is migrating up I'm not saying you're going to go long all the time obviously here in this instance we didn't actually get the next day giving us an imbalance out of the you know like a break out of value pullback opportunity so it's fine we wouldn't be interested but if we did can you imagine it's going to give us that much more conviction to want to go along here value migration is sideways so we're going to be thinking if the next day opens in a rotation which it did you know it's a great opportunity to stay rotational but look what actually started to happen and this is really important is and this is why it takes time to develop this you know I wanted to mention this to you right at the end in the final kind of video is so you can add this to your arsenal after you've developed all the other things that I mentioned because then this will become much easier for you to understand but essentially if you think of this whole period here once this day came in I would personally be thinking look we haven't gone anywhere for all these days so I'm just going to merge all of them right merge profile begin merge profile and hopefully get a nice yeah there you go see a really nice balance up in there so I can delete that delete that okay so hopefully it's really clear to you now what I mean by value migration because now we've got two very strong cva here we've got our cva here you know you can as I said I don't I keep this all mentally noted as I'm trading throughout the day but you can write this stuff down whatever's easy for you you know discussed it to death but basically you can call that a and b what has composite value done I don't not talking about individual days because we're interested in what high time frames here what have multi-day investors done to value pushed it up would you agree look up okay that is value migration why is this so important because if we open up outside just giving us a huge amount of conviction that high time frame guys multi-day investors are trying to move this market higher now I did say that you know the exception was if we had a big gap in terms of the open so here you can see we actually opened up quite a fair distance outside you know you're talking about this is why it's important just know your market because here we're talking almost 150 200 ticks opening outside of the sort of composite value area high so you know you've got to expect that there will be an attempt to come back but as soon as you get this kind of retracement if you like or whatever and maybe you get some rotation you know you want to really be starting to get along right this market and then we just continue this process and that is what I'm talking about when I say value migration and I really don't want to over complicate it you know this stage value migration is up here I wouldn't necessarily merge these two but I would definitely merge those two and you could merge these two I suppose that looks pretty good and look this isn't an exercise obviously in merging you know we've discussed it to death as to how there can be some subjectivity you know maybe in some circumstances I would have not merged those but on any given day you know it just depends what your sort of processes as you're going through and obviously I haven't really got time on this video to obviously compare every single one in depth and detail but whatever let's just assume that we do merge those so can you see again value migration up okay then we come in here and again can you see big gap up so you've got to expect the market to want to close that gap somewhat and then we move up now look the reason I'm not doing this as some sort of live sort of example is because I don't only use this right this is the point this is just one building block I'm giving you this kind of final building block to put into your 70% that I can add to your main kind of final task so that you can now go away over the next few months and however long it's going to be and really start to develop some real quality hypos why because if you think about it your hypo now is going to be incredible because you've got your you know your hypo is basically forming up or if you think of the triangle really this was the only part missing was thinking a little bit about multi-day just to some extent because if you think about it the order flow you've got it now right cumulative delta and so on and so forth and obviously you can combine that now with the VWAP on a intraday basis and then the composites we were looking at you know where are we relative to our line in the sands and so on and so forth and actually what I've done is I've just come in and added in sort of this migration here so you can kind of almost just complete it this just added in a nice little layer here at the bottom and for you to really give you some kind of extra bit into your sort of final hypothesis that you will now be using going forward so hopefully that's helped let's just do a couple more just to make sure that everyone's got it so again like I said as you keep sort of doing your composites on the day just keep it simple and ask yourself what are multi-day investors kind of doing at this stage and are they achieving it so again in this area obviously we know that value migration is very much up right multi-day investors with big money are pushing this market up how do we know that massive structural shifts in value not individual days moving we're talking multiple day blocks themselves moving up so hopefully you can see why that's so important so we've got this individual day I wouldn't consider that a structural shift because it's just one day then we come in here and we kind of that's a shift so another shift up probably merge that's not the greatest is it again I don't want to necessarily get into detail you know you can obviously decide based on the entire section I did on composite values whether you want to kind of merge that or not so sorry move rightmost yeah I'm not too sure about that just because if you think about it kind of went imbalanced out isn't it what you could do you know I don't really like doing it much but so let me just split this out that's what I was going to do is split the profile there you go so what you could do is you could just merge those two right right and then you've got some more kind of migration up and I think I may have mentioned before I don't mind on the other occasion doing splits if we've already had multiple days prior to it I just wouldn't necessarily want to do one and a half days or something like that so then you know we continue to go up and obviously have these great do you see here how you didn't have this issue of a massive gap here it was quite a nice opening very close to kind of aligning the sound and then obviously it shot up so that's all I mean be a bit mindful of obviously the big gaps and then over here we opened up and then you know we have this three-day period where we merge with next profile merge with next profile and then obviously we cut that okay so here you can see we've actually now had value migration down and you know this is the thing you want to monitor this so you've had actual value shift down this value my value CV has moved down and what you want to do is you want to ask yourself all right what multi-day investors able to achieve can they continue this does this value migration down fail well look we've got a massive clue here it's failed it's actually come down and look what's it's actually come down and look what's happened we started to develop composite value area upwards so to me that tells me that these original multi-day investors going up this was just a retracement and we come up okay this is where multiple days of sort of value itself looking at how composite value excuse me composite value itself is moving can be incredibly powerful because at the end of the day it's the most the more number of days you've got obviously the more kind of strength that value has right it's going to be more credible value in terms of what the market where the market kind of sees it so you can see here we basically went back up this thing we failed really this value migration down failed in the sense that we came back up and we overlapped the previous composite value do you see i'm not talking about these individual days here okay individual days is a separate matter okay we use that in our hypothesis of course we do and we look and we see and that's kind of part of our intraday right the stage two the dva bit is kind of covered to a large extent already in the day we're looking at multi-day what is actually multiple days trying to achieve and there you see again shift it up and so on and so forth and so you can see if we shift it up there so you know it's going to give you confidence if you kind of open up outside of here to you know if you're whatever type of intraday environment you are in obviously if it gives you long opportunities great if not wait till the next day or whatever and so on and so forth and you know and then we just continued and obviously again composite the same thing happened right but we built composite value areas down cut this out okay and the cva did what migrated down okay but look it doesn't matter the fact that it migrated down the market went up who cares we didn't actually have any opportunities to get short anyway i'm just saying for this little i mean it's quite a large layer but you know what i mean this big layer here at the bottom in terms of uh you know forgive me about that because it's um out of market hours right now um this little layer here in terms of multi-day investors and you know what i'm not even going to try and write it out because my handwriting is terrible but yeah you get the point it's we're looking at cva multi-day investors how because what is a composite it's made up of multiple days combined together what are multiple days themselves doing so hopefully that's clear um obviously if it isn't you know feel free to ask and um you know happy to explain further but you know it should be very clear this composite uh migration failed we came back down but then what happened and i'm not going to merge them you can see we started to shift up again okay so again you know this move is going to be very strong because value migration down failed and actually we started to migrate up okay so hopefully that's really clear it's all about um how you can within your existing sort of template your existing chart book you don't need to get complicated and add in a ton of charts you know even if you've got a laptop or whatever you're using and you've got your composite on the left you've got your um sort of so if we kind of throw out here you've got your chart book okay you've got your kind of cva here okay and then it's split down the middle you've got your devia here and then you've got your cumulative delta here right you've got your order flow well now you've even got higher time frame and this is almost just that if you think of the triangle right this entire triangle um chunk the 70 percent is now covered within your market profile now that you've got value migration as well as composite value area you've got both incredible amount of information on market profile this one market profile is obviously incredibly powerful and used heavily heavily heavily heavily by institutions and then you've got your obviously your vwap and your intraday kind of developing value to see how you can trade around static value and obviously value migration so you've got that here and you've got your order flow which we discussed in stage three so everything is there that you need to develop an incredibly powerful hypothesis for the day and execute it okay so hopefully that's really clear um ladies and gentlemen and i hope that was helpful that i've come back and actually added this extra bit in to really help you wrap things up and look at the end of the day i want to put my money where my mouth is it's nice i've given some live examples throughout um the course and i think it's quite nice and you know i want to differentiate myself by really making this one of the best courses out there and therefore it's important i end everything off with some solid live examples which incorporate everything you've seen here so i'm going to use exactly the same chart book and show you how to bring all of this together with two live examples and then we'll just wrap things up so let's crack on and get on with the live examples okay traders so as discussed um i did record or managed to record myself doing a live trade on the es and crude oil now obviously when i record myself i don't know how long um the trades are going to last so you know it could be 20 minutes 30 minutes one hour two hours three hours who knows unfortunately i managed to catch some kind of variation so this es trade is i don't know if you can see it's one hour 10 minutes so um we'll see it through it will obviously give you a really good feel in real time of what um i'm obviously doing and going through and i don't even get that anywhere else and like i said i want it to be one of the most um realistic comprehensive courses out there so um i think it's quite nice for us to just sit through what i was going through i mean i can't remember exactly obviously in the moment what i was going through but you know because i'm trading obviously in quite big size and it's quite nice for you to see in the real time um what i'm actually going through what i might be thinking and obviously bringing all the stuff together so i'm gonna hit play and actually what happened is it was coming into the open and obviously when i hit record i wasn't hadn't really thought about what i was going to do but very quickly i realized i wanted to buy the market so you'll see that when i hit play i do end up um getting long of the market and rather than me doing the whole hypothesis here for like the next 10 15 20 minutes and then hitting play and then sitting through it i thought what we could do is just hit play obviously you can see my executions and stuff but we can do the hypothesis at the same time that i would have been going through now my hypothesis i've said it before i'm very honest person it's very quick but you know i've been obviously doing this for many many years so the time it takes me to make a decision um has obviously diminished and drastically reduced over the time period so you know within a few minutes i kind of know what i want to do and i don't write it out i've been very honest about that but i'll do that for you here so you can start doing that you know it doesn't matter if it takes you 30 minutes 40 minutes before the open to come to the decision it should be taking you that time because that means you're doing it properly and you're evolving and over time months years you will reduce that and it become much quicker but um look like i said you know it's not easy for me to record myself and all of that i've tried my best so you have to forgive me if it isn't kind of perfect and in fact these examples are brilliant because they're not um perfect in the sense that they are kind of difficult examples difficult decisions that you'll have to make and i'd rather show you difficult trades than just easy trades where we're all imbalanced and market common area imbalanced and whatever no i want to show you where you're sort of combining value migration with obviously using static value on its own and then using you know not necessarily just an imbalanced environment but also a rotational environment with that and what's the thinking behind that and the order flow and everything so i'm gonna hit play and then look you you've got to part with me for about an hour and 10 and then obviously there's the crude oil trade as well so we'll go through everything let me just hit play okay so uh let's have a look here so you can see it's the you know just obviously there you can see it's the sort of live market at the time and um you know you'll have to forgive me i just realized after i did the recording during the week that um because it's um obviously i'm sure you understand because i'm doing large size i don't actually like to have my pnl showing you know psychologically or whatever you want to call it even after all these years um you know i've got a rough idea obviously of where my pnl is but look i've seen it many many times even uh and you can see i just took a long position but um it's important you know this i've seen it affect traders who've been trading 20 30 over 30 years they don't like to look at their open pnl uh not everyone but majority of them and you know it's because you don't want to trade your pnl you want to obviously strictly trade your hypothesis you know so that's why i don't keep it so you'll have to forgive me that i don't have the actual um trade management in front of me and actually i like to have i have a very little small chart that i execute on so you'll see i'm actually executing just on the side and um obviously i can't record multiple screens so um i don't have that up in front of me but you can see that i've opened up obviously um uh two contracts in the es so at the moment it's quite small size it's only um about 25 dollars a tick so um you know 12.50 each so um obviously you don't really want to be doing this in the futures market i mentioned this before do it on your sort of retail broker or whatever a much smaller size um and kind of just build it up from there but obviously i've built it up over time so um you know obviously for me i'm quite comfortable with it but even then you've seen i don't like to necessarily stare at my pnl going up and down you know five hundred dollars thousand dollars up thousand dollars down several thousand up several thousand whatever all over the place and it can be quite distracting that's why i like to keep it off the screen so i thought i'd just mention that um but look getting on with the hypothesis the point is that um and look the thing is i don't even do this as you know i mentioned i don't necessarily write a hypothesis down but i want you to do it um so i've just got some notes here around um this sort of stuff that i want you to be writing down in terms of the structure um and i think i gave you some outline in the previous tasks right four or five etc um so those are the outlines i think i've written down and i want you to come up with the cva so um initially if you think about it um what would you be having on your hypothesis so developing your hypothesis really from kind of the bottom up right so you've got your cva if you remember your 70 percent your dva and order flow right so here is very much your cva as we talked about here's your dva and here's your order flow so as i've just said at the start of this section you've got everything you need right don't over complicate it even what multi-day investors are doing so let's really start off with this value migration right and again even though i'm writing it down for you here and i don't necessarily write this stuff down don't think that i don't think about this okay this was very much in my thought process um the way i was starting the day and you can see i've taken the long position there and i'll explain why in a second why i got along with the market but look we're here for as i said over about an hour so we've got plenty of time to discuss the trade and i do believe i may have actually added to the position but in terms of the value migration what if what multi-day investors actually trying to do in the s&p500 look at that moving up right we're coming into the open we're here at three two six six we're right here you know we're about to go in balance potentially a breakout of value pullback value migration is up so you know you can kind of write that down value migration up you'll have to forgive my writing obviously because this is the live market i can't use the text function that i told you about before what's my line in the sand very much this area isn't it there you can see i've just added in again as some buyers came in order flow started to go strong and the market started to just turn a little bit um i felt like you know editing so now i've got four contracts there which you can see so it's about fifty dollars a tick um at this stage and i've just kind of got my first scales around the vwap and then kind of going because the trouble is i don't have you know normally your target so here you would say or should my target be your target if i was here then i could quite easily say right my target's here i don't really have a target so i'm being quite conservative and saying fine i'll just take it off kind of where the rhythm is now ideally you want it to be there but i thought the market was already fairly stretched i mean look we've been moving up up up up constantly right in my mind i'm quite happy um you know with 10 points i mean you're talking obviously significant amount of money you know round about 2k on the day so i would have been happy with that if i'd got all my fields but um i can't remember exactly what happened on this day but um um because it was about four days ago sunday today so yeah it was thursday i can't remember exactly but um because i still got to do my review for the week where i cover i'll go through all my pnl on the weekends and stuff i've yet to do that i'll do that after making this uh video but um obviously here i can just see off the top of my head that look 66 to 76 77 um just slightly above obviously on four contracts with scaling you know somewhere between one and a half 2k so i was pretty happy with that um if all the targets hit here so let's come back to this so cva my value migration is very much up right so multi-day investors top um they call it a top down right but obviously here is kind of a bottom up but just because of the way i've done the triangle value migration is up line in the sand is what where are we well we've kind of trying and we're holding this area aren't we this lis and you know believe me my point is this is what is going through my head you can see it here i'm actually putting real money on this stuff this isn't just some theory of actually doing exactly what i'm kind of giving you the same framework to do i'm doing it myself okay so that's why it's important i'll show you this um real example and then also take you through the kind of structure that i think you should be going through and you can obviously amend it yourself and you might be getting in at different areas and stuff like that but um you know the process no reason why it can't be quite similar the targets was tricky as i said here ideally i would target the other side of value bolt there is no you know value in this area so i was kind of happy with target being plus one sd and scales at the vwap okay my line in the sand was uh three two and then in terms of the um dva and let's have a look here so what have i got you guys doing right so you want to kind of see what was the overnight doing and so okay so basically i kind of obviously had a long bias right because i was thinking okay look breakout value pullback so this context here was very much a long bias okay so 70 of it breakout value pullback for the reasons mentioned value migration up we've built some decent kind of value above and you know obviously you can have obviously you can have volume profile here i'll be honest with you i'm not over the years i can kind of just visualize it that we've built value above here i don't need the volume profile here to tell me that but if you want it by all means you can have it i prefer as you can see in the real market real contracts i don't necessarily use it myself i kind of like it to be clean where i can just see okay has the market actually achieved anything above where the line in the sand is well yes overnight has buyers came in they did all right um but however you know we need a caveat here what was the rhythm and the market condition well it wasn't ideal because we would have wanted it to be obviously some sort of normal trend fast trend whatever imbalance it wasn't was it imbalance failed okay but what we're starting to do we've been to the plus 2sd and now we've been to the minus 2sd and done what held and actually if you look here this is the minus uh 2500 what is the order flow actually done it's gone down overnight it's gone up it's gone down it's rotational right and that's my point um let me just i think i might have the volume on this on and just turn it off i beg your pardon um so i had the volume of my recording pre-recording on so i just turn that off so again um coming back to our sort of rhythm and market condition right the market condition the rhythm is like uh would you not would you agree it's like a 2sd right we've gone up 2sd come down minus 2sd so that's your rhythm what's the market condition therefore imbalance failed however there's a rotation had this rotation happened you know down here down here somewhere i may have been thinking actually i don't want to get along yet but have we built any sort of value below the line in the sand no right and this is the point and you know this is why i say it takes a long long long time to develop this type of thinking because there's a lot of moving parts you not only need to be thinking about what has happened you also need to be thinking about what has not happened you know we haven't been able to really make any inroads into our composite value area here we're well above it we traded some volume above here we've come back tested this area and done what failed so imbalance up failed but also you know this is where you can start developing a narrative and my handwriting is going to be terrible but cva high failed to build volume below right so we failed to really come in and go rotational here we're in this rotation so dva dva rhythm is plus two minus two i don't know if this is going to hold of course i don't right and ideally i probably would have wanted this to kind of go up come down go up one more come down again and then enter but look we don't live in an ideal world obviously sometimes you know you're coming into um the time that you're trading this is the time that i'm trading and obviously i just wanted to take a chance at it so that's what i did and that's what trading is all about it's about taking logical opportunities you know and you can see you know my stop was um the other side of where i felt the rotation might fail okay we hadn't really you know i talk about the high kinashi turn we hadn't had that at this stage and we started to but um for me i was very much using the order flow okay i could see this it's very microscopic but i could see this area was holding this area was holding but very much in a rotation so i knew if we start to see buyers coming in here and we see the 2sd holding is in line with my market condition okay so my thought process is and look i don't know exactly what i was thinking on this day but just looking at it and obviously i've done this thousands of time i kind of know what would have been going through my head i would have been thinking all right early buyers just got stopped out um we've come back you know we're still in a very rotational environment more than likely if we've managed to go up to the plus 2sd we're not just going to collapse straight away we could we could sell off but more than likely we're going to at least attempt some sort of rotation um hold so it could just go back up here to the vwap and then collapse right i don't know that's why i'm taking some scales if i get them right typically i'm quite conservative on my first scales because i'm always weary that things like this can happen where you just sort of fall off you know you don't know that so it's decent take some scales be safe um you can go for you can not have scales and just ultimately go for there but then you need to do that all the time right to kind of balance it out and you're going to have obviously a bit more of and i've talked about this a bit more of a jagged equity curve and eventually you might end up much higher than i will i prefer to have kind of a smooth equity curve but then you see my end point at the end of the month it might be lower but my drawdowns will be low because i'm scaling so it's just a matter of preference there's no right or wrong um so let me just see did i miss anything else out no i didn't so that's basically you know a really good strong narrative for the day we've covered off cva we've covered off the line in the sand we've covered off the migration we've covered off the vwap market condition and rhythm right so that's the tick in the box tick in the box we've covered off the order flow or we said it's quite rotational you know and i understand i talk about the zero line a lot but also you've got to think outside the box and think hang on we held below we hold above we hold below possibly gonna hold above it's a rotational environment so you really got to be aware of that in terms of the order flow picture it's not you know this is not a green light red light system they do not work you know this you get paid alpha to think outside the box right you really need to think of the overall context of what what are we actually doing it's not just about when we're below zero you sell when you're above zero you buy it doesn't work like that you need to think of the context of what's order flow been doing all day has it actually been above all day has it been positive all day has it been negative all day have we been failing to really be positive or negative in which case it's obviously going to lend itself more to a rotational environment okay so obviously i'm not going to talk throughout this whole process but as much as i can will give you you know as much of a insight into what i may have been thinking at the time and i do actually vaguely remember watching this thinking you know i wanted to hold i really want buyers to start stepping in if this had kind of started to step away and obviously the sellers start to hit bids and this really starts to fall off then you know probably wouldn't have been more really interested in this trade okay so i believe i may have actually added another contract in there just because i was just liking you know and i don't want you to be as aggressive as me obviously i'm a when i see things i like i really liked how this was holding i've said it you know multiple times that i really liked how the order flow was really failing to go anywhere if i'm honest with you you can see it the buyers are coming in there you can kind of see it it's like having your own dome and don't forget i watched the dome for so long i can kind of just see that if you look very closely you can see that cumulative delta bar is going positive as a bar on its own okay and what that means is people are lifting offers all right you know they're really not going anywhere there's no aggressive selling coming in which is why i added a little extra contract there normally i deal in clips of two so you see i got one two three four but then i just did one clip so i was conservative i wasn't going crazy um i just felt that it was worth the risk of just one extra clip for me to put in rather than my usual clip of two so you'll have to forgive me for being rude but i'm gonna drink my tea because obviously it's a long video just making sure i haven't missed off anything in that hypothesis so we've discussed order flow in detail dva we've discussed in detail cva we've discussed in detail we've also talked about the migration so i think one of the things i would say about the migration and why it's quite important is because the value migration is upright so clearly multi-day investors are um you know getting long of the market and you know if we if we have this if we have a line in the sand here and we have a line in the sand here right we're coming into the day here and i know value migration is up you know in the past i've said to you uh you know this should be strictly speaking a breakout value pullback down as you come out you go imbalanced you know the market's obviously being balancing here you come down because value migration is up here i would actually be a little bit weary and if we fail here something happens some order flow or the market condition changes and we start to build value up i'm going to be quite happy for this to become a kind of return to value pullback in line with value migration so hopefully that's clear obviously that didn't happen on this occasion we actually did open did open imbalance relative to the composite value area so and that's the uh open there you can see the market just opened all the flow still holding and there you can see people lifting offers at the open this is why i don't like looking at having my pnl open because it would have been fluctuating at this point it might have made me exit prematurely uh you know because it is obviously the open and it can be a little bit volatile so i don't like to watch the pnl i like to just keep an eye on the order flow that's all that matters so for me the open and it can be a little bit volatile so i don't like to watch the pnl i like to just keep an eye on the order flow that's all that matters so for me are we are sellers able to um kind of drive the rotational market in their favor below minus 2500 you know this area is so crucial if i see strong selling coming in you know i know it's curtains really as you can see there you know i'm pretty sure that as soon as i see this buying coming in i'm probably quite feeling a lot more comfortable so and actually if you think about it it's very different to the live order flow examples because in the order flow examples there's lots going on i can talk through it this bid here offers their numbers this that blah blah blah etc etc here very very slow you know and this is why it's quite nice for me to do one of these examples because you can see oftentimes it's very relaxing you're just kind of waiting around for stuff to happen i mean obviously you've seen the length of this video is over one hour so you know it took an hour for this to really play out and actually if you watch the video really slowly i'm adjusting these levels ever so slightly because i'm my first scale i want it to be at the vwap so there look you can see it okay you can see buyers coming in right and i've actually taken another one position so i'm now up to six contracts okay because i saw the aggression coming in so again on the simulator it's fine right trade this stuff don't do this in the live market because obviously it's in the futures market you know it's six contracts is um yeah you're talking around 75 dollars a tick on the es that i'm obviously taking on so you know and i've watched maybe thousands of days in real time so obviously i'm i'm very comfortable with what's going on here i can see that the buyers are coming in we're just failing to obviously break down and therefore there's more chance this rotation is going to hold and actually stick stop doesn't really need to change much because we've got the minus 2 sd there and obviously if we start breaking that down the rotations failed and more than more than likely we will go imbalanced you know i'll take a little bit of a loss it's fine in this environment taking five six seven points is absolutely normal um of heat that is obviously when the market's a little more quiet then you wouldn't want to take as much i mean but you can let the value kind of standard deviations almost guide you to some extent so you know my stop i'm not really thinking in terms of um points or whatever i'm thinking more in terms of market condition changes right and i talked about this during the entry and exit so you know what the reality is nothing's really happened in this area apart from us holding which is very positive for me you know that's why i was getting quite aggressive more aggressive than most people would just because i was obviously watching the order flow here but the reality is not much has really happened and i know i keep saying it by watching your pnl go up and down it'll drive you crazy so i highly suggest just stick to your plan you know your thesis here narrative you know and just keep updating it as well throughout the day so you can keep kind of writing it down throughout the day that okay this has changed that has changed this has held that has held whatever have your notepad make some notes at the end of the day go back and observe it so okay you know what this order flow broke down and i still got stubborn and i held the position next time i'll make sure i don't do that stuff like that that's what i've done in the past actually um a lot especially when i first started trading um the markets is i would have like a diary and i would write these things down and i've discussed this obviously earlier as well when you were developing your hypo but um just trying to make sure i haven't forgotten to do anything in terms of the hypothesis that i want you to follow in terms of structure obviously if you've got your own stuff you're doing anyway it's important i say this at this stage because it's the final video of the whole course um got no issue with it you know if you're doing your own stuff in terms of high time frames this that or entry methods or anything and this is just helping you contextually to add layers onto that fine do that you know therefore your hypothesis may not be the exact same it may have cva some um sort of rhythm and market condition but then it will have some other stuff that you already look at if you're a more experienced trader for me obviously i prefer volume analysis and as you've seen throughout i focus heavily on uh what i believe to be the only fabric of the market which is the market orders obviously but look there's many different ways to make money and trade and i recognize that so if you've got your own kind of way of doing it in terms of what you want to add on top of this and you feel it gives you some edge please go ahead and do it never say never but at this stage obviously it's looking less and less likely that the sellers will um at least be able to get an immediate push down so again be looking for this really to at least test the vwap and then vwap is the average isn't it and then we kind of see where we go from there as you can see i'm taking off the bulk of the position there so fingers crossed you know you get your scales at um kind of the mean which is the vwap and then you just kind of i guess reassess when you get there would be my suggestion which is typically what i'm doing throughout the day you know i'll see if the rotation holds get to vwap and then reassess things you know i like to take off quite a bit of my risk there um sometimes i'll add if i think it's you know the order flow is right and it's really strong and i'll add into it but sometimes i won't it really depends on the order flow here i can see the order flow is whilst it's held here i know for a fact i do get quite nervous when we're coming into the obviously the zero so um you know i really want this to just have that quick um stop run so to speak so you know a lot of people have clearly got short here come down and i just want this little blip just because obviously they'll they'll be some of these guys who have you can see it they've sold quite aggressively um into going short they're gonna wanna obviously offload some of that risk if they if we start to sort of get a pop back above the composite value area then they'll want to obviously exit out of some of those shorts which is going to help at the end of the day because if you're short and you need to exit what you do hit buy that's always going to help my position so um there's two ways to look at it obviously it's not ideal that you're building all this kind of volume below the cva but at the same time we're not in terms of the order flow this is why it's so crucial to combine everything together even though the order flow is a small amount use it contextually use it with your context right here it's important because contextually what are you trying to do is your thesis you're trying to hold this line in the sand and what's the order flow telling you in that circumstance you're struggling you're struggling sellers are struggling to really get much traction and therefore you should get a little stop problem so um so just making sure that i had my levels right so it's about five points so about four contracts there so just under 1k um because i see five points is what about 20 ticks on that first contract uh so first scales and then what is it it's about 50 isn't it 50 uh dollars because it's four contracts so it's about 1k if i can get that exit that is you see what i'll be looking at again rather than worrying about my pnl at this stage which is easy to do especially when you've got size on this is why again i know i sound like a broken record that's why i don't like to have it in front of me i'm really i know what i know myself now after all these years and i know what i would be kind of looking at here and it is said it many times is i'm just looking at the order flow okay and i want to see what's the order flow doing you know is there any reason to be worried by you know these little tiny kind of cells in price is it actually backed up by real sellers and you can see here it really isn't i mean it's very weak the selling it's not um and it's still in line with context right which is the kind of rotational order flow is the context holding it's funny right in a way order flow has its own little triangle order flow in itself has context right obviously we don't have a vwap around order flow so we don't have this deviate bit but we've very much got this sort of contextual element to order flow itself where we want to kind of see what it's uh doing and there you can see again people willing to lift again i was a bit nervous that we're getting back into sort of the neutral zone because it's kind of making me think all right maybe some of these sellers have already decided to neutralize themselves and stop out and therefore we don't really know which way in terms of positioning the market can really be utilized to help us but just the way that we were holding this involved this sort of morning here we're just kind of holding this area still sellers weren't able to do much i was fairly confident that we were going to test the vwap you know obviously as you develop as a trader when you now go away after this on your own and these are the things you want to be looking for they're all going to be slightly different every day of course i can't give you every single combination because there's so many right every day is quite dynamic um see some reality is a lot of guys just stops it's going to be at least the initial part of it there's just going to be a lot of these guys getting stopped they may not necessarily be getting stopped here they may be exiting obviously some of these short positions because they're thinking all right maybe we're gonna have to take too much heat right now it's not quite ready they're nervous that it could easily turn into what rotation and then go down if indeed these guys are obviously betting on the market um reversing obviously for me i've got a long bias so i'm going to use that to my advantage at least up until there and then we'll see if we can actually get up there or not but yeah so coming back to the what i was saying you know it's um so many combinations and you know it's important that you just as soon as you're applying some structure and you're just observing you're going to develop the right sort of mindset using um obviously order flow and all the things that i've taught as the basis for that understanding as opposed to all the random stuff out there that you see you know i've said it so many times all the indicators etc etc okay so you can see um a lot of offers being lifted here buying coming in nice strong buying i'll be honest with you sometimes when we come into this this type of neutrality and i've mentioned it in the order flow section and we're not quite a view at a real scale but the fact that we've managed to go positive means that i am holding um on at the moment just see if we can actually get to view up if you notice it's very subtle i'm actually just moving my take profit just ever so because what's happening all the market orders are developing or building below the vwap so the vwap is actually moving down so i'm having to constantly adjust ever so slightly my um take profit so you can see i'm just ever so slightly adjusting these as well um it's amazing people talk about trading being glamorous and so on so forth you see it's quite can be quite boring sometimes isn't it when you're actually in real life watching in real time you know that's why i wanted to show you this that you know in real time it's can be very steady and sometimes can be very slow you know just waiting for things to happen and here the buyers are definitely getting much more aggressive and we're almost there at vwap now so it's like taking about 40 minutes isn't it to get there so most of the positions got taken on the fifth one got taken out there uh oh sorry the fourth contract got taken out there so okay so i know it's not very clear but if you actually look here what that means is that basically i have had one two three four five six contracts which we talked about so what it does is it's minus one so it's going down to five minus one it's going down to four minus one it's going up to three minus one it's going down to two so i took four contracts um out off there for approximately four or five points so somewhere just just shy of about 1k um on those contracts and then i've got two contracts left so i'm pretty relaxed now because obviously i've secured some income for the day um and then we'll just kind of see where we can go and i think i believe i was talking and i didn't really i missed it but i think i did move my um stop up there so just just kind of protect the position really and you know what there's actually absolutely nothing wrong even if it does pull back again and then go like that and but everyone's different and this way no two people are going to trade the same way i do tend to be after i've done my first scale before my first scale i'm pretty relaxed as a lot of you guys know i'm quite relaxed about my stops because i'll stop myself out dynamically if i have to and so on and so forth but once i've kind of secured my income for the day i do tend to be quite risk averse in the sense that i do like to um at least stuff that i've banked already obviously i don't want to eat into that too much but i know many amazing traders who make you know ridiculous sums of money who would be happy for this to pull all the way back then and they would even just maybe even happy for it to see if this whole rotation holds and they'd give up a decent chunk of that just to see if they could actually get to the other side and it adds up over time the equity curve isn't going to be as smooth i mentioned this so there's nothing wrong with it i don't need you to do exactly what i do it's just obviously everyone's different i'm kind of just like to give you a live example so you can see i do obviously do this um you know for a living and basically it's important i don't just show you market replay and actually show you you know that i am trading the market obviously uh regularly but um my point is not that my point is that just because i'm doing it one way i don't want you to exactly do it the same develop your own style to what you're comfortable with you know i like to just have some income in the bag most days and just keeps my equity curve moving up nice and slowly you know nothing wrong if you really want to you know boost it then just accept you're going to have some days where you do bank you know a decent amount but then you'll have to give some of that back if you really want to go for the um see if the rotation holds you know so i don't mind either i mean to be fair for me plenty of times i've seen you know this in this scenario because the order flow is quite strong that we will go and just kind of complete the rotation and therefore to me i think is it really worth the sort of because everything is obviously about dynamic risk reward now the risk reward has changed at the start the risk reward is different now that the order flow is coming we've kind of got strong do i really need to risk this um all the way down to there no i don't because the order flow dynamic has changed now you know we're above the zero we've seen people lift offers uh the market condition has held i don't want to risk as much all those things are in my favor um i don't necessarily need to see if those things are going to hold anymore those things have happened now they're ticks in the boxes and you know it's really important um i'll just obviously say this because we're waiting for stuff to happen but it's really important that i say all of this because a lot of people ask me about risk reward and things and this is a true sort of dynamic risk reward and this is when um you kind of take all your clues into account and say all right things are happening how much should i risk because you know certain variables have changed as the trade has developed so obviously here we didn't know it was going to hold it's probably worth taking a little bit more risk just to give it some space to see if it would hold um here we see it has successfully held and gone up and you know if we don't now continue and actually we start to break down again you've got to question whether the trade is still valid so do you really want to have as much risk on the trade i would argue not so that's why i no longer want to kind of have my stop there to see if the rotation holds i just want to basically see do we very quickly move up um and the whole market starts to not only these guys have clearly um taken some stops but do we now see fresh buying or is this just a little stop run of these early sellers and now they're actually gonna be able to get fresh selling coming in and drive the market down so i don't know either way so for those reasons i'm happy to obviously reduce my overall risk and what you'll also find is obviously i'm trading you know big size here and as soon as you start doing that you will notice obviously things will affect you to some extent you know i'll be lying and i'm a very hopefully you can see i've got a lot of integrity about me the way that i do things and therefore you know i don't want you guys to think i'm perfect and these things don't affect me they do and obviously i've got um you know big money on the line and although i move my pnl out the way so i don't get distracted by it of course it affects you you know there'll be times where you think at the end of the session you're reviewing why did i do that you know a lot of the times it is down to money but it does help knowing what you're doing and of course you can see i've got a very strong framework which will tell me that um so i'm very certain i know what i would have been looking for here is i just want to see if this holds and this sort of rotation really pushes us up a little bit more and we can just sort of finish this rotational move right so what i'm really looking for is to see if these pushes up are they actually backed up by any sort of order flow right or is it just um is any participation we talked about this in the 3.2 section do we get any participation in this move um so really the point is sometimes it's good to keep a diary and just constantly be updating the sort of hypothesis for the day and the narrative so in the order flow section is there anything new yeah look oh we kind of changed something changed here i'm now seeing you can write all this down you know and i did this for years i'm not i don't do this that much anymore i've been open about that but it's just what things you want to be doing is making a note of it you know um the order flow contextual uh sort of story changed i'm waiting to see great perfect we tested vwap got a nice bit of income there look also if you see here we're holding this area now that we've broken above here i really don't want us to come back down because i know it's probably curtains for this trade so another reason i'm very comfortable to just risk a little bit really because i really want this um line in the sand to hold here um obviously only time will tell um but again you know i said this before but it's almost funny how this is very different to talking through a depth of market isn't it it's very uh slow and to some extent it's much more relaxed you know hopefully you can see why i do this though as you know i've transitioned off the depth of market and i do like to look at cumulative delta and obviously more bigger forms of value in terms of market profile value migration multiple days maps together obviously miles away from what i used to do with the depth of market so i'm going to be honest with you i was watching this i do remember um on this day on thursday i do remember thinking that oh we had this push up right but look at this the order flow is not pushing up we're just not getting any participation we're not getting any follow through um very weak and i probably was wondering whether i should um you know typically i'm not the type of person i won't just exit the position just because of that um but obviously it's just something you're thinking about all the time and even more reason um you know had i not moved my stop where it was you know below the 2sd i was holding for the contextual hold had i not moved it at this stage at this stage i would have definitely moved it up by now because obviously i can see there's no participation in this move up so hopefully that's very clear so again you can see that you know if you're on your iphone or whatever watching this it's going to be difficult to see this but when you're back at home on your desktop or whatever's your laptop just literally you will see that this cumulative delta is just not the people are not if you think of the depth of market of all these little offers right sorry they're here aren't they people are not hitting or lifting the offers aggressively as they're moving up in net terms yeah that offer's being lifted there's just no sort of net positive delta when it comes to those offers being lifted so often what i like to see is this vwap move i don't mind obviously i'm giving it some space don't get me wrong i'm not going to exit just yet i don't think so anyway like i said i don't remember exactly um what happened we may have even gone to the other side i can't remember to be honest i took some crude trades towards the end of the week so i had quite a bit of trading towards the end of the week and i can't remember exactly what happened in this but i just know that i would be watching this type of stuff so nothing wrong with you just stepping away and saying do you know what i've got my stop in place i'm just going to walk away now and leave it but um obviously everyone's different i'm kind of sitting around doing other stuff anyway so i like to just keep an eye on the order flow and see what's happening obviously that's me on the day doing that live um so in fact what i did there is i did take one off i took another one off just because the reason i know this because i just saw what i did there i basically did exactly what i've been talking about i looked at this very um you could almost say pathetic order flow coming in here and i just thought look there's just no aggression people are not buying it let me just be a bit cautious and take one of my scales off one more scale up so it's just adding to my income for the day really you know i'm not going to complain at the end of the day i picked up a very chunky healthy piece of pno and i've got one contract on and i'm thinking all right i'm going to give it another chance just to obviously break this vwap vwap is incredibly powerful you know that's what's happening everyone's looking at it thinking are we able to break through the average can we go above the average below the average right it's very normal when people when we're above the average people think of it as bullish obviously below the average um you know in anything in life really so obviously the vwap is incredibly important to the market i recognize this so that's why i'm i've obviously scaled right you see that i've now scaled pretty much 90 initially i'd scaled about 75 and i thought let's go for a break to the other side it's not happening right you can see it look here the order flow is just not following through therefore i'm happy to take out the final bit as in just one more left so about 90 out now just got one contract left and you know because i want to see if this line in the sand here holds you can see i even moved it up a little bit my stop i just moved it up so i'm getting very nervous is the wrong word but i'm dynamic in my approach all right so you can see it here you can actually see some bids being hit there market is just not going up at this stage that's what i'm doing with this crosshair i know what i'm doing is i'm checking the order flow versus obviously where prices and what we're able to achieve and you can kind of see it there really the price is not going anywhere okay so i can just see here we've got about 10 minutes of the recording left so i apologize i know it's been a long one but i think it's quite useful like i said for you to know exactly what i'm thinking not just me fast forwarding i would have done that i would have done this look this is actually in real life with kind of real money right this is what i am doing i'm not making perfect decisions sometimes you know i could i'm not making perfect decisions sometimes you know i could be wrong i can't remember exactly what happened here but um i can't remember did i exit too early i've got a lot to be honest with you i've got a bit of a blank at the moment i can't remember if we did manage to get this out whether we just fell away and maybe i just got stopped on the last bit but the point is do you see i took a scale manually there we still may hold this area and go on and take that out it's easy to say in hindsight oh i would have not done that and i would have gone there and you see you've seen in real time i don't know what's going to happen next i didn't like something here i took a scale i could have been wrong and we could go up right and the trade could i may have had an early exit this is my point in real life it's not perfect everyone's gonna react differently everyone's gonna read the order flow slightly differently the way i read it there was it's weak some of you may be thinking hang on now we're holding it's not i don't see any problem with this i'm not gonna take this extra contract off i'm gonna give it time we're back above the line in the sand we're holding we've built this kind of volume here now i'm gonna go for that this makes sense to me whereas for me i thought i did think that obviously that's why i still got one contract but the point is i also had another contract where i was thinking all right maybe i should be prudent and just in case the fact that this is not following through as quickly as i would have liked we're constantly butting up against the vwap and we're struggling a little bit here and the order flow has not been great all day to be fair it's kind of rotational let me be prudent and take one off right this is critical thinking at its best doesn't mean i'm going to make the right decision it just means it's a decision based on very logical real things happening in the market not oh it's 50 percent not it's a trend line not do you see all that stuff is all nonsense this is what's actually happening in the market and you can see it here and if you make a decision and it ends up costing you money it doesn't matter because if you're constantly making the right decisions based on the fabric of the market eventually you know with all other things being equal you will be able to develop some edge hopefully if you're making the right decisions and you're obviously combining all the factors well and you know like some of you like i said before you're gonna have your own sort of additional bits and bobs that you want to add on top of what i'm showing you and that may ultimately develop that type of edge for you for me but i kind of give you everything i've got there but obviously i've developed a way of my way of reading it over many years um but you know obviously that's something you need to develop but the point is i'm not always going to be right that's my point right i've taken the early exit i don't know whether it will go to the other side or not but let's just see you can see they are struggling there's no buying coming in here so what i can say is that i did not trade any more es after this i can't honestly i can't remember if we took out that contract or whether we got stopped but either way i do remember that we didn't uh or i didn't sorry trade any more yes after this and um because i'm already sitting here thinking and i'm kind of analyzing this myself and i'm thinking what would i have done differently watching this back now obviously you don't have the opportunity of hindsight in real life so now i do i'm kind of thinking well anyway if whatever the market did is kind of setting up for either some sort of rotational environment it's not really setting itself up or giving those type of clues that this is really going to go anywhere today just because of the pace and like i said the order flow isn't really strongly positive it's been quite rotational so again write these things down throughout the day they're just observations and watch them throughout the day and see if they actually play out the way you think they're going to and then obviously learn from that so all right so there you go you saw basically quite a bit of selling coming in and we've basically gone nowhere right the order flow's gone nowhere so um let me just pause this i think that's basically that so see i'm out of all my contracts so um that's pretty much the end there was about five minutes there at the end where i just let it kind of play out but um essentially you can go back and check this thing i can't remember exactly what happened probably we just went nowhere i'm just thinking because i know i didn't trade again after this um so yeah if you see the order flow kind of being flat we haven't really gone anywhere and fine so i made the best out of what i probably could have where i took this potential um plus 2sd rotational market condition expecting it to kind of go rotation i did actually manage to take a massive chunk out of the market um and obviously took a tiny hit on one contract but overall very positive for the day um at least on the es um because i think i did do the cl trade on this day as well and had another as in the cl trade was on this day as well i can't remember i'm gonna start the um recorder i can't remember which one i record had a couple of nice cl trades either on this day or it might have been on the next day i can't remember but anyway this was it for the es and i think the point i'm trying to make is that i don't really see any trading opportunities now that this has happened that's why i didn't really trade anymore i didn't really want to get short back into this area just because i felt like the order flow just didn't you know it's pretty rotational we kind of failed but um at the same time i kind of felt like well there isn't really much doing because it wasn't really aggressively short right the order flow wasn't short there wasn't really anything um how do i say in terms of the context that was telling me sure we had the value migration up as well i was kind of happy to walk away that day so look anyway i hope that was really useful for you and gives you a lot to think about as you've now completed sort of the program and you've got a lot of stuff to go away and think about this gives you a really good reference point for how um some of my thought processes are in real time and i'm going to give you one more after this um crude oil i think it'd be great to have a different market and give you one more example so yeah let's crack on and look at that okay traders so same thing here but obviously with the final example of the course is going to be on this crude oil live example that i took and as you'll see um i'm gonna what is obviously this one's a little bit shorter it's only about 25 minutes so i'll just quickly do the hypothesis um for the day before i hit play um just so it isn't too distracting basically um just give me a second this pen doesn't work unless the screen is off maximized so there we go so initially it's going to be the same sort of thing you know i want you to do is when you're doing your hypothesis and you know again you can always reference back to this where you've got your cva dva now this is the way i do it obviously if you've got some stuff you're looking at i keep saying variation do it if not obviously stick to um pure order flow structure if you want um obviously it's what i'm doing so here again let's just recap what we've got here is that very much um in terms of the context we've got this element you know within this part of your chart book including the value migration which we're going to look at in a second you've got your developing value area with your vwap there and then you've got your order flow in this section right so you've got that section this section this section all covered off on your one chart book um plenty there to develop a very solid hypothesis for the day and if we go they call it top down but obviously i said this before during the yes example i've got it bottom up if we very much start from the bottom right so we want to kind of develop our also a longer term sort of hypothesis well you can see here right you've developed very much value migration up would you agree so multi-day investors are trying to push this market up so my spelling is going to be terrible value migration up what's our line in the sand well it's really this area isn't it and this is a great example of where i know i've said to you in the past i want you to keep these lines in the sand and when you're below obviously look for imbalance down when you're above obviously look for either imbalance above or obviously a return to value pullback and when you're below look for a breakout value pullback right but because we've obviously introduced the value migration now if for example here you had opened here i've got no issue you know given the correct context if you've got strong order flow and obviously you've got some sort of market condition that's obviously in favor in terms of being long guys look for this line in the sand to break and go for a return to value pullback okay so no problem with that just bring the value migration in and it will make sense when you bring it together obviously in this instance i'm just going to stick to what was happening on the day because i do want to give you live examples obviously and rather than do some more market replay etc etc i would rather just show you exactly what i was thinking on this particular day and here the line in the sand was 4107 the day before we'd come up and you can see what happened overnight we just kind of drifted and we were around about here at the open we're just about to open right that's my line in the sand value migration is very much up big investors are trying to push this market up um line in the sand was 4107 right you can see it here 4107 you can see it there 4107 i'm looking for a breakout value pullback very much what the high time frame trend is up pullback retracement look you see it value migration is up we've got a nice retracement it's long all day right i mean obviously we want to make sure that intraday developing value i.e what's happening on the day is very much up and it isn't right i mean this is what i want to show you like this type of example because rather than show you a picture perfect example i want to show you sometimes i will try and preempt i will of course be looking at rhythm and market condition right rhythm market condition what was the sort of market condition here it was imbalanced right it was imbalanced down however what i noticed is what was the rhythm well it was it was kind of failing because if the imbalance down was kind of like uh normal trend right you see this part of my thesis and this is what i said during the order flow section that really the context is everything i'm looking for this market to really push on up i'm looking for any clues that this imbalance down may be looking to fail right so what do i see here well i look at order flow and i see right okay here you have this big move down but look at this you've got absorption coming in right the order flow is very weak and again this is why i say almost order flow has its own context to it where is the order flow well look it's at minus 500 okay ladies and gentlemen it's not at minus 5 000 minus 10 000 minus even 2 500 but you cannot say this order flow is kind of supportive of sellers if the order flow here was like this obviously i might be thinking hang on but the fact the order flow is going nowhere the market's really just drifting sideways and this normal trend look it's failed once it's kind of struggling i'm kind of thinking to myself hang on okay ideally i want it to break that and then go up because then my rhythm which is very much a what is it a 1sd right so this is the 1sd i was going to say normal trend but it's 1sd my 1sd has really broken and the order flow i would put here um i was going to say weak but actually what it is is the sellers are weak because i agree look on a dva basis cannot be denied we are in balance down and obviously the sellers are in control to an extent but what's the strength of those sellers very weak right look at the order flow very very weak it's drifting we spent pretty much the entire overnight session right um in terms of the order flow anyway positive okay not only that right and i do remember buying the market um i think i pretty much bought the market at the open so as soon as i hit play i do buy the market and um big reason for that is look at this divergence so i saw right at the open i saw sellers try and push this down what happened failed completely absorption huge absorption i'm already thinking to myself in terms of my narrative you know my sort of 70 percent is long with uh migration or with um obviously multi-day investors so um i'm gonna put migration but it's really multi-day investors right um waiting uh my handwriting is going to be terrible so you'll have to just obviously take it verbally as i say it but when you write it down obviously do it neatly spend your time doing this before the session um but really waiting for what market condition change waiting for market condition change on dva order flow already hinting would you agree it's hinting as is the fact that you know we didn't really we went all the way up to vwap right and even here just look at this area okay i mean you could argue you'd be building some volume here on a volume prepper but again i said it before i've obviously i don't really use that much myself i can just see it right i mean you can see it you can see that you are building sideways action here uh volume in terms of market orders and also here the selling is really slowing down here and this condition change i'm going to be the first to admit it to admit it ideally but i would say wait wait for this rhythm to change the first standard deviation and really give you some clues that it's going to pop i mean i got a little bit aggressive here and i think i might have added in i can't remember what let's press play and see what happens anyway um so you can see i'm just drawing in the divergence there um i can't remember exactly i'm pretty sure i got along at the open somewhere here but yeah you can see i've just drawn in the divergence and like i said i don't like to see my pnl in front of me so i do have a little kind of tiny chart i just use for execution there you go i just bought the market um let me just uh clear some of this out so you can just see what's happening um okay so the stop is just below this um cva high my line in the sand of 4107 which i've written there um yeah i think i'm just going to give it a try again i don't remember exactly what i did now you'll have to forgive me you can see we've just opened up here we're above nicely above so we've very much got a narrative in play i'll break out value pullback ideally i did say i would have wanted to wait for this rhythm 1sd to change i did take some more risk on there a little bit more on there so one two three four contracts so my clips are two so look it's not that i got very aggressive it's that i put two on and then i put one and one instead of two together just because obviously i saw buying coming in so i just thought all right so it's important you know look if you're going to get aggressive don't just add when the market goes against you you see here the market's going in my favor i'm happy to add okay you got to do it both ways if you're going to do all that stuff and now to just just keep it simple and just obviously keep your scale in scale out fairly straightforward obviously i did get quite aggressive on this occasion there you can see some buyers coming in market is being lifted and you see really here this would have been if i see any sort of movement back that's the ideal time to get in but again a little bit of experience but mainly it was this divergence and you can see how the narrative really helps you to me it's a very clear narrative value migration up we're outside of our composite value area high a line in the sand i didn't put one thing here and i do apologize for the target clearly we want to kind of be aiming for this area and that's why i had my ultimate target in this area all right i was a little bit shy of it but it's fine that's why i had targets in those areas and again you know like with the previous example i'm kind of just going approximately for the vwap all right okay so i've got taken out there the vwap generally i'll always be targeting the vwap i just want you to see even when i'm trading real contracts right four contracts here you're talking about what i'm doing is i'm just circling the zero line all right so it was two things it was also vwap and obviously we were coming to kind of where the market was neutral again and i talked about this in terms of the order flow and therefore i was happy to take two off but my point is look even when i'm trading for real this is what i'm doing i'm scaling out vwap okay it's really important um you can see even the rhythm was where we've kind of tested the vwap for all i knew this could just collapse i don't know right the order flow is still a little bit suspect okay fine it's not weak because like i said it was um the order flow here weak sellers as in we just kind of drifted we're at about minus 500 nothing we're back to zero now it's not like the sellers are you know absolutely hammering the market up and we're at plus 5000 nothing like that but i'm giving you a chance to develop and what i do like now about this a lot i really really like this is that the rhythm has changed like i said this happened quite quickly obviously screwed oil is a little bit quicker sometimes nes right down rhythm has changed okay as i said this rhythm here look at it we're starting to build some volume above here we come back that ideally would have been a conservative first entry obviously it's a little bit more advanced i saw this absorption i liked the narrative and i did go for it right long and i have to accept the consequences if i get stopped out i was comfortable with that um so that's what i was doing there so you can see i had four um i've now got two so minus one takes me to three positions minus one take me in two positions right so forty dollars a tick down to twenty dollars a tick right i mean you know we're talking um obviously fairly decent size um but the point is just because i'm changing uh um obviously trading size it doesn't mean my game plan is any different i'm still thinking all right so you want to go for the uh vwap as a first you know the average really is like for me the most obvious first scale so you can see i moved my stop up slightly um just to obviously lock in some of the day's income um again i don't know exactly what i did here but the fact that the rhythm again is being tested you know this this kind of one st rhythm is really starting to fail you know and i've said this a lot it's not only about what what the market's achieving it's also about what the market is not achieving right so it's not managing to hold this sort of normal trend down and the value migration is up right so you see here value migration is very much up multi-day investors are looking to push this higher you know you may not want to get long but if anything you don't really want to be getting short into this market so i wouldn't personally be looking to get short and i would be looking for clues to where are the shorts starting to fail as a clue so apologies it's not like the dome where there's like a thousand things going on every second so it's not really like minute by minute or second by second where i can give you lots of new information because a lot of it is quite as you can see do you know what for all i know i don't even know if i was in front of the screen at this time i may have just walked away for five ten minutes it's perfectly normal 20 minutes just if you want to walk away and you've obviously moved to stop you've got your scales and so on and so forth do it okay you don't need to sit here and stare at the order flow i really don't know if i was there at the time because i can't see my mouse moving but because oftentimes even i will step away from the markets i'm waiting for something to happen but typically if i was here i'd probably be watching this order flow to see because like i said i like this rhythm change right rhythm was 1st normal rhythms changed it's pulling back i'd be looking at this order flow thinking okay are the sellers strong because you know my narrative is very much the order flow for weak sellers is that narrative sticking you know you've got to remember you're probably told a million times in the past forgive me not all of you but anyone who's done in general the commercial space in terms of education is you know once you enter a trade leave it it's all nonsense right it's dynamic for all we know sellers could come in aggressively and this could drive down it changes the narrative of the whole market right we then want to see do they hold do they fail do they manage to gain anything is there opportunities if they fail here for us to get back in if we start to move up again and so on and so forth things will be changing my point is on this occasion we're really looking to see if the rhythm changes it's already started to change and then therefore on this little pullback is there any significant selling so far i can't see any you can see it there yourself it's very um weak the selling doesn't seem to be any selling we're close to zero really sellers are not getting anything even if they are trying they're not really getting paid are they so in fact there you go look it looks like i just took another position there yeah so that's very much in line with i don't know 100 because this was a few days ago but i'm just obviously i know myself better than anyone so i can only assume that i was looking for a rhythm change here and i must have recognized that the sellers were very weak on this pullback so i added in again okay and i added again so i'm back to my full sort of clips i was at the start which is forty dollars a tick for contracts okay so two contracts i've probably got in the region of around 20 ticks so about four hundred dollars and then i'm obviously back to my full size of uh four contracts now i'm just kind of comfortably holding in this area i really don't want to be in this position too much if it pulls down here because order flow would then probably would be quite strong in terms of for the sellers you know it's not like order flows up here at plus sort of five thousand and we're just having a normal pullback order flow still hasn't developed into anything positive however i'm comfortable because the seller's got nothing done rhythm has changed right very much holding so we just see see what we can achieve you see i'm back at my good old vwap i'm happy to take kind of 15 ticks out the market on at least one or two of these positions as we head back up to the vwap you can see the market's just moving with the migration okay value migration up went up the day before retraced overnight we're just moving back up clear targets obviously with clear targets for scales as well at the vwap and you know you'll notice and this was quite nice for me to show you this example because in real time you see i look even me i've got a lot of um sort of size on the market and therefore even i fiddle with my take profit a lot and i'll be thinking this is why i don't like to have my pnl in front of me because sometimes i have noticed you know historically obviously i will be kind of trading the pnl thinking i'm up a thousand dollars two thousand dollars let me take that i'm up five hundred dollars let me take that with this i'm kind of thinking more no let me take the trade when structurally it's right to take it which is around the vwap okay and also the vwap just happens to be around you know the rth highs the session so you see i just moved it down i'm being prudent i'm not thinking about my pnl i'm thinking more all right the vwaps because if you think about all the market orders have been developing below the vwap so what's been happening to the vwap look it's going down pushing down so at this stage my my kind of take profit might have been there now i've had to move it down because obviously the vwap is moving down as well okay so i'm just waiting for my first scale okay so i just got taken out of one then i think i manually took out the other one just because we're heading into kind of zero territory neutral territory we're at the vwap i'm holding we're holding sorry at the moment so so if you remember i put on four i took two off i put two back on i took those two off right so those two extra contracts have come off and in fact it's first in first out is the sort of methodology used so it would have been all four contracts here taking about 20 so it's only about 800 and then obviously my ads are here where i'm targeting slightly higher so i've locked in about 800 obviously i'm risking a little bit of that here there you go i'm definitely awake because i'm obviously moving my mouse on the day and let's see what i'm doing you know similar to the es picture we're kind of just waiting for vwap to really break at the moment a lot of these sellers they're not giving up right some have given up which have allowed me to obviously scale out and take the vwap part we're still waiting to see whether all of these sellers are going to give up and new buyers come in seeing that bang and the market just pops up at least to kind of the first standard deviation area which i do like i like that area you saw in the es it's nice for you to see two eggs two markets because you see i'm kind of following similar principles in each where i'm very much trading towards sort of order flow or market order determined value areas right the vwap is determined by market orders the plus first standard deviation is determined by market orders okay this is not determined by anything any sort of formula or any sort of um how do i say it formula is the wrong word it's not determined by any sort of filter process right that all these technical indicators go through it's much more a market driven statistic that's what it is obviously there is some formula involved in terms of calculating standard deviation which i went through in incredible detail but all the components of standard deviation are what market order driven right you're just looking at what are you looking at the actual market orders variance or deviation to what the mean the mean is what the mean of the market orders right so that's why i like using these developing value areas including the vwap itself as areas for me to scale out of so again i can't remember exactly i'm going to be honest with you what happened here still got about 10 minutes left so we'll let it play oh it was a funny one i mean you know it can just pop so for all i know this did but i can't remember honestly i can't remember what happened i do like these examples because it'll be easy for me to show you perfect examples where we're what imbalanced up and the order flows up and i just say oh yeah just keep buying dips up and i just say oh yeah just keep buying dips replacements and you know all that trend following type stuff and it's all nonsense right look end of the day i hope you really see that i'm trying to show you um you know real life in real life it isn't like that it's not going to be picture perfect sometimes you're going to have scenarios like this it's not exactly how you want it but you've got to use that out of the box critical thinking you know where i've said all right it's not perfect however the sellers are looking weak we've had a couple of attempts of rhythm change earlier in the session that wasn't quite working as in the sellers were unable to kind of hold this rhythm and the rhythm change was obviously being attempted by the buyers all right it's not perfect we haven't had this sort of rhythm change up and then the pullback however we've got massive absorption here we're only at minus 400 selling's been really weak on this move down i'm going to give this a go do you see completely different type of thinking to i don't know waiting for some sort of signal to happen or some sort of filter to get you in because i can assure you it's too late everyone knows it by then and they're all in and out of the move okay so still waiting for this um to happen again i know i keep saying it but it's nice that i'm not doing market replay because in the replay obviously you can make this happen quite fast you can see in real life it is slow sometimes it will be very boring it will be a lot of sort of hanging around waiting for things to happen sticking to your guns um you know i want to show you i go through this a lot pretty much every day i go through it you know where i am waiting around i am waiting for things to happen and you know obviously i go through that process of will it won't it don't know you know and as you do it thousands of times you do learn to be a little bit more relaxed about it and learn what to look for and i know there's a lot going on but it it does get easier with time so as i said earlier what to look for and i know there's a lot going on but it it does get easier with time so as i said earlier i know i'll be looking at this water flow in this region just just as i did in the es just seeing what are we doing here right and you see i just moved my stop up to there and a lot of that is because look as i said in the es example there's no buying coming in really i don't see much um happening here in terms of the buying right we're really struggling in terms of the market orders if you think of the depth of market we're not seeing aggression coming in in terms of market orders or even if you think of the footprint section with the delta we're not seeing positive delta and that's as i talked about in obviously 3.1 3.2 i like to look at it on cumulative delta it's really the same to me i was watching the depth of market you know you can see here look the net delta is going negative and can you see i just took another scale that's why because look where there is no sort of buying coming i could be wrong right it could just pop and this is just a temporary sort of hold up the sellers are just being a bit stubborn they're not letting go and then they will and it will just pop who knows my point is i want to show you even in real time i'm making decisions don't always mean i'm don't always mean i'm right again i don't know what happened here with the last contract but i believe there's just one contract left i've put my stop you know pretty tight here i've already taken probably about a thousand dollars out of the market just in terms of um obviously having i believe four contracts one two three four maybe five contracts i took off and i got one left i'm not 100 sure like i said i've got to do my review for the week so obviously i'll double check my pnl but um it's definitely four and then the four came off i think i took one more if i can't remember as in i can't see it's not very clear to me here okay yeah i see that so i was just looking here so what happened is obviously i took the two two off two ads but then because of the fifo rule as in first in first out the initial two of the four got taken out so four are out then i had two left right so the initial four i took about 20 ticks one so about 800 and then this extra one i took one contract i took what was about 10 ticks so maybe about 100 and then i've got this one contract left so again i'm not 100% sure what happened here there we go got taken out that's a pretty decent um day's work there um okay so i'll just pause that there's only three minutes left basically and it just would have just been the market play so look we're almost done and my point is i hope you can see and i hope you appreciate these are great examples because even though you're going to have targets right you're going to have these um sort of targets up here i want to show you they're not always going to be you know people always tell you have these targets and this is what will happen it's all most of the time i'm going to be honest with you those targets they're not going to hit right because the market doesn't move like that all the time so you need to be scaling obviously you need to be managing and i think it's nice for me to show you kind of what happens in real life most of the time i do as you see have bigger targets and sometimes maybe 20 30 40 percent of the time it will go to those targets and that's nice it's a nice boost to the pno and you do want to hold it because it will make you money hopefully if you do it correctly obviously and you manage it dynamically as i've shown you it will add to your bottom line but most of the time you know you're scaling out you're building income for the day come back the next day and you just keep doing it and then eventually you know one or two days a week you will get those um bigger targets but it's nice for me to show you what happens the majority of the time that you know it's not picture perfect you don't have these beautiful targets up here cvas they always get hit because they don't always get hit right most of the time it is a bit of scaling obviously just managing your trade managing your sort of take profits making sure you're obviously managing all of that dynamically as i've shown you here just keep an eye on the order flow you don't need to stare at it you've seen there were plenty of opportunity to walk away here for 10 20 minutes come back just check the order flow kind of see what was happening are we developing any sort of strength to push through the vwap and really push to my next target my roadblocks and so on and so forth so hopefully that's given you a real good idea of everything i feel like it's a really nice way to end the course off on in terms of ending on you know a nice live example in the way that um sorry the way that i ended um you know most of the sections that the depth of market section the foundation section the order flow section in terms of the footprint and then here i think it's really nice to end it and kind of show you realistically kind of what i'm thinking about during the day yeah look i hope you've had as much kind of i don't know the right word for it but you know i hope you've kind of enjoyed the course as much as i have putting it together enjoyment's one word but also kind of because for me it's also been a great learning experience as well it's been a great opportunity for me to consolidate a lot of the things that i've sort of learned over the last 10 to 15 years really um you know over a decade now that i've been in the markets and um you know various institutions doing slightly different things so you know doing pure outright risk taking um obviously really just over a decade but you know being in the markets obviously 16 17 years now but um i hope that you know you've enjoyed as much as i have because like i said for me it's been brilliant really consolidating a lot of my knowledge and i've already noticed because i came back and i've done this video as you notice um a few weeks after just finishing all three stages and honestly i've had a really good two months and i think a lot of that is down to this opportunity that you know you guys have given me to share my knowledge and i realize it's really helped me as well to consolidate that and made me sharper and always made me question things um so really it's been massively beneficial for me so i want to thank you for that but i also hope it's been very beneficial for you and hopefully you've got a lot of information that you can now kind of take away and i know it's all very new and there's going to be a lot of work and there will be and you know it's going to take many months if not years of developing this understanding and kind of maybe even tweaking it to make it your own and um you know if you've got any questions obviously feel free to reach out but obviously that's very much the end of um everything now um and yeah like i said any questions let me know again i just want to say one final time thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to um sort of share my knowledge with you it's been brilliant for me i hope you found it very different to anything out there um and yeah you know if you've got any questions let me know um have a great day

Hello traders, welcome to the section where we're going to do the installation really quickly because we already did the dome installation and obviously I went through that in much more detail. There's really no need for me to go over this again, it's exactly the same process. Go and check the depth of market installation, it's just a different file, so I'm going to put a different file in. But what I've also done in this section that's really important is I've basically done a what I look for when I'm looking for a trade using the footprint section because what happened is you'll see there's a live trading example. Now at the moment, at this moment in time I've only put one trading example, live trading example and I reviewed it and I realised it's very very advanced and I realised that unless I do a dedicated section where the chart is static so you know exactly what I'm looking for on a very basic level, clearly spelled out for you, I've realised it's going to be too confusing if you use the live example I've put in. So I thought what I'd do is I'll quickly show you the installation and then I'll quickly show you what I look for and then in the live example you'll see I discuss it in much more detail but the type of example I show you in the live example is a bit of a variation, so if you use that to learn, I recognise it might be a little bit confusing. So let me give you more of like the textbook, what I'm looking for and then you'll see in the live example how it's a bit more advanced and how it can vary and then when I get time I'll put in a bit more of a picture perfect example. So the reason you see depth of market here is because all I've done is I've kept the depth of market, you can get rid of them if you want and just use the footprint, like I said in my trading pro course onwards we're not really going to look at the depth of market so let's just minimise those and in fact on my futures trading I don't really look at the depth of market so you can get rid of it. I've just kept it there for completion sake I suppose, I mean it's there anyway so I thought I'd just leave the decision to you and then as you can see you've got here G7FX Pro footprint chart book, so that's the one I want you to load, you've seen the process how to load it into the sierra chart file and into which folder. Now what I'm going to do is, I might as well just go through this with you quickly because the futures may have rolled since the last time so I just want to remind you how I'm doing this and actually it may seem to you that oh this process is quite involved and envy, do I have to go through this every time but don't forget this is an extreme example because I've put five futures contracts in here, typically for my futures trading I'm only looking at a couple and then maybe the currency so it might be only, I don't really follow the treasury so that's one less and then don't forget all the contracts are three months, it's only oil that you need to be updating every month and if you're not trading oil that'd be one less so you know I wouldn't worry too much about it, it's a fairly straight forward process but what you basically do is you go into the name column as we've already gone through, you click find and then for each one I just go through them one by one and because you've clicked on treasuries already it will load it up so you want the next three so June, September, December and then what I do a little trick is I just write it down so I know I'm looking at June so ZN is the contract that's never going to change so I just know that what is going to change the only thing here is the year, the year changes once a year come on it's going to be 20 we all know 20 is 2020 if it's 19 2019 if it's 21 2021 so that's easy the one that sometimes can be hard to remember is it March, June, September so it's the middle letter HMU so I just write down the next three so you see is M, U, Z right so I've literally written down M, U, Z so you can see it there in the middle that's really the only thing that's changing isn't it because look ZN and 20 remain static throughout so I know for the treasuries the next three are M, U and Z which is June, September, December and the thing is look I know that the e-mini S&Ps runs every three months I know that the British pound runs every three months I know that the euro runs every three months the only other one I need to check is crude oil because it's going to be different to M, U, Z if I double click on that so I double clicked on the crude oil contract click on find it's under NYMEX remember look I can see the next three April, May, June same concept CL is always going to be crude oil 20 is 2020 and so yeah the only thing changing again is the month isn't it so here you can see J, K and M so I just write that down J, K, M are the next three then what I do is I click cancel that and don't forget your codes are going to be slightly different to mine because as I did in the code clarification video I believe you just don't have this bit after the 20 in any of them so that's okay because you've got the delayed data this is assuming you don't have live data so don't let that put you off you just need to obviously make sure that you don't have this bit afterwards futures NYMEX whatever so basically all I'll do is I'll just go down and I'll check is it M, U, Z on all of them so you can see here's H so I change that so we're doing this together Z, M, N, M so that's M, U and Z Z now there's not much volume right now because as I'm recording this it's the futures markets just opened that's why you see very little volume but that's okay the concept is the same basically so again you see I've got H there so I'll put M just changing that middle letter M, U this is the best way to you know you'll have to learn this at some stage because look ZN we know that's the treasury 20 year 2020 the bit that sometimes get hard to remember is the month June is always M, SEP, DEC and anyway we want to see what the next ones are so it's M, U, Z, M, U, Z then for Crude Oil remember I wrote it down J, K, M is that J yep that's J that's K yep and that's M and then we just these ones are three monthly aren't they British Pound so M, U, Z again so look that one change to M, U and then Z and then same here I've got M, U, and Z okay now normally your charts are going to prompt you anyway to do a futures rollover but what we can do is we can see ourselves what's the most liquid contract in each of these would you agree look there's nothing trading in September, December in the treasury so we know the most liquid contract is ZN M20 right at the top unsurprisingly S&P 500 is the same June Crude is the middle one isn't it May look May's got 3,491 now in the daytime unfortunately I'm doing this right now when the market's just opened that will be more like 200,000 and that will be more like I don't know 10,000 or whatever but the point is it's the most liquid contract it's got the most number of contracts in it so it's at the moment the May contract and then again as we saw before in the British Pound it's June there's nothing trading in September or December and then in the Euro it's June as well so what I do is so what I do is I've got a little trick where I will obviously check on my charts but I also will you can also check on the window just to make sure so you can see that we just agreed that for all of them it's June and June is M the letter M so what I'll go down is I'll just go and check that they've all got M and then crude is the only one that's different it's K isn't it so can you see here it says M20 M20 M M and then crude is K so I know that's right and then I'll just keep going down basically that's M M M K which is what I wanted isn't it K there you go K and then M M then the crude oil futures there is K M and then with the footprints if you see again we've got the correct contracts because it's M which is June for most of them M M K M M so they're all actually correct so if I minimize that so what I'm going to do now is in the footprint what you've basically got you've got all your depth of markets you've got the same so you've got exactly what you had in the dome but now I've given you all the footprints okay now I don't actually use the treasury footprint because it's too thick a market look at the Renko that I've got up here it's two ticks guys end of the day this market it's just too thick for me to be using the footprint I don't trade it so I'm not going to go over it but what I am going to go over because we're moving on now obviously to the pro course we're looking more at some of the more orderly markets with good moves in them we can move on from the treasuries now the treasuries was just there so we could learn the depth of market stuff and get to grips with order flow because it's a bit slower we're advanced now we're moving on we're moving on to slightly more normal markets in the sense of a decent range that we can actually grab using charts rather than using the depth of market because if you try to trade treasuries of a chart you can drive yourself crazy because it just doesn't have the movement or the range that you're after so I typically tend to stick to much more meatier markets but with good order in them so the S&P500 and crude oil are generally the two we're going to focus on because I look at those all the time and they're the most heavily traded futures in the world anyway treasuries is obviously very liquid as well but it tends to have not necessarily as much speculation from across the spectrum so I just find these markets better and like I said you tend to get bigger moves in them so you can grab more meat out of moves so basically that's what it boils down to so the first one is the e-mini S&P let's just go through them one by one in fact because the example is on the pound let's start with the British pound so if we go to the GBP here so the first thing is so essentially that's it that's the installation covered I've given you the same five footprints which is the US treasury the e-mini S&P crude oil British pounds and euros if you want any others it's the same thing you can go to chart do you remember how you did with the depth of market I showed you how you can duplicate chart and then within chart settings and then symbol find and you can pick any one if you want to look at something else that's up to you okay but I'll put those standard as five it's custom built but again happy for you to use that on any other instrument it's not just dedicated to those five markets I've just kept those five in because they're a nice broad spectrum of thick volume to very thin volume that's all it is so the first thing I did promise you guys is I said to you look I'm going to explain to you how I'm going to explain to you how I come up with this tip number for the RINCO so what I do is basically what are we doing we're looking for turning points aren't we so what I do is I'll scroll along and I look for decent areas where the markets had big turns now I want that to be nice and smooth don't I do you remember I said the whole point of us using the RINCO is that I want 100 candles or 50 candles or 10 candles which is what you get when you use minute based chart because what the candle will keep forming regardless I want as much information in one candle as possible so I can really see the turn and that will become apparent so I can see trapped buyers and sellers easily because they'll all be contained within one bucket so what I do is I look for turns but what I've found over time as well is approximately being able to see one to one and a half hours is really key seems to be a good fit so 60 to 90 minutes so let me write that down you can make a note of it again use your experience watch it yourself but if you're asking me to give you what I look for it's about 60 to 90 minutes I find that a good frame of reference for us to look for what people's get trapped and then have to bail out and we can obviously position ourselves as you're going to see in the live example that I've put already put for you in the pound and I'm going to try and get better examples because that one was very advanced as I said so as you can see here at the bottom it's about what 4 pm to about 5 5 30 there so it's about an hour hour and a half and you've got a nice turn so at the moment in the pound I'm using the five tick wrinker which is what I mentioned to you I think in the examples I've been doing so sometimes during the year that will change but I'm going to give you a little head start here you'll notice when I do the live example I do mention in there that actually you know maybe and in fact not even maybe I'm going to give you some alternatives to using the footprint in the future especially for effects because the volume is quite thin so you may be able to get away with that but that'll become clearer when I give my whole spiel in the next section for now we're just concentrating on how we pick the tick number for our rainco bars because look let's let's do it together let's say you go to studies um sorry not studies what am I doing settings chart settings and we change this to four right can you see you've suddenly got quite a few bars here right and then look at the time period you've gone from about 10 past 4 to 444 it's just too much info look what happens here can you see basically what's happening is in this area look it's not going to be perfect every time but ideally you want that to be bunched up together because what's really happened there nothing it's just sideways movement same in these two so as you saw with the five it was quite nice because it it brought all of that allowed it to be cumulative we discussed this already many times so to me five is a good pick there's nothing wrong with going with four but it's just more info why do you want more info the same info sorry on more candles doesn't make sense to me to do that so if we go back to chart settings so instead of four this time I'm going to go to the other extreme let's go for six can you see guys what's happened too much information by the time I get in the market's moved okay so six you can see it's not well calibrated to this environment either so that's what I'm doing I'm looking for it to be a smooth turn and I'll typically do that once a month or so or when it becomes obvious to me that it's not calibrated well but usually my calibrations will last for several months at a time so that's good news for you so that's how I'm picking my calibrations you can go and play with them but the way I've left them is for the current environment you may obviously be doing this course much more in the future maybe a year or two after I've created this in which case your calibrations may be very different I'll try to keep the template as up-to-date as possible but obviously that may not always be practical for me to do but so that's what I've done with the tick hope that becomes I hope that's very clear to you and I'll just show you you know what I've used for euro I've used four tick using and I'm not going to go through all of them I'll let you do this in your own time I've put four tick for euro because I thought that worked pretty well um crude oil I've got six tick and then um S&P I like the four tick raincoat can you see how smooth the turn is you don't get much bunching up of data here if that makes sense you just don't see it you know can you see all the turns they're really nicely calibrated um it's a load of examples I remember when I was trying to calibrate this is what I'm looking for can you see it the turns tend to happen within as fewer candles as possible because that means they're accumulating all the trapped buyers or sellers so I hope that makes sense that's your footprint um enjoy playing around with it I'm going to see you in a sec and we'll discuss exactly what I look for okay guys so what I've done is I've moved the and I'm going to use S&P futures for this so what will happen and you'll notice this um when you go to the live trade example that's the pound now I may have updated it since but as it stands um I showed a really good example in the pound and it's because it showed so many um variations of what can happen it wasn't a picture-perfect example majority of the time you're going to see this type of action that you're looking for but that example just had everything but I realized when I was reviewing it that unless I did a dedicated section where we're just going to talk here not for too long maybe 10 15 20 minutes I'm just going to show you exactly what I'm looking for on a static chart when I go to do the live example there's just too much going on I've realized that now so I've actually backtracked a bit and I've added this bit in into the installation section where we're going to actually look at exactly what I look for in a textbook example and then what you're going to see it's really good actually you'll see in the pound trading live example how it can vary you can get slight variations um okay so what I'm going to do is because actually it's worked out well because I've already put in the pound live example where I was trading live um pound yen and using pound dollar futures I'm going to refer to that a little bit just so it makes more sense when you go and do that example but um I think the best way to think of this is let's say you've got some contextual level so you I think the best way to think of this is let's say you've got some contextual level so you see in my discord or it doesn't matter if it's in my discord later on I'm going to show you how to find your own contextual levels to some extent but let's say it was um this area right this area here that's your area of interest you know and I'll just get rid of this now because we don't need it let's say you're here at 9am and you've seen me do this all the time I'll have contextual levels especially in FX that I put in discord futures I do it as well um in terms of the e-mini S&P and crude oil but I don't want to confuse it too much because it's essentially it's the same thing I'm looking for levels where I know I'm going to be trading later so what am I typically looking to do if I'm here at 9am it could be either that I have a contextual level up here and I'm looking to fade that level and it can be a continuation or it can be a mean reversion back into value but in this particular case just because this is what I did with the pound I'm looking to do the same thing but at the other extreme so the market I'm looking for the market to sell off and then I'm looking to fade it same thing applies the other way um you know if I was looking for the market to rally and buyers to get trapped here I'm looking for sellers to get trapped so number one question you've got to ask yourself is what what am I looking for what exactly is it you need to know in the morning am I looking for buyers to get trapped or sellers to get trapped so if the market levels contextual levels that you're looking to fade are below you you're looking for sellers to get trapped right if you're looking for the other way which is the market levels are above you you're looking for buyers to get trapped okay pretty straightforward so far so if we're looking for sellers to get trapped what does that mean exactly it means there has to be heavy selling right would you agree the more selling there is the more sellers that are getting trapped right the more people if you're selling and the market goes against you what do you have to do buy what direction am I going to be taking a buy so the more people that sell would you agree the more people eventually that have to buy the market so that's why I want this to be incredibly aggressive and this was part of the problem when I show you the pound example because of coronavirus etc it was I kept saying in that pound example you'll notice it because I hadn't built I hadn't done this bit yet and I kept saying look guys normally you want it to be incredibly aggressive the selling and I just wasn't getting it but I still got in the trade for a bit more advanced reasons this is a perfect example when I was talking in the live example of saying you want aggression of heavy aggression so what exactly am I looking for so number one is we've said right trapped traders so in fact if anything it's always going to be trapped traders okay so how am I basically I guess what I'm getting to is how do we define trapped traders well it's heavy negative delta isn't it because remember what delta is it is what buyers minus sellers so if it's very negative there's more sellers so that's what we said we were looking there's more sellers so that's what we said we were looking for so essentially what I want to see is heavy negative delta you can see it there you see it minus 415 guys minus 592 that means look at you can just visualize it now the first things I'll look for I'll be honest with you is I look at these delta columns can you see the difference between them so you can see these aggressive selling look at the delta percentages here 72% and remember what delta percentage is if you don't go back and remind yourself it's just the difference in the percentage as a total of buyers versus sellers if that's confusing go back and remember the formula the ratio but can you see the difference in these candles versus look at these green green green so visually I first like to see a lot of red I like to see red heavy heavy red so I guess you could call it and I refer to this in the live pound example but it will make more sense here so remember me saying it here I want to see concentrations of and you can make notes of this but concentrations of sellers and you can use this interchangeably with buyers if obviously you're fading levels at the top this is for obviously when you're fading a market that's moving down because again to remind you sorry to labour the point because obviously some of you will get this easily some of you won't but the more sellers you have the more sellers that need to bail when what the market starts going against them they're going to be crapping their pants you know oh my god it's going out boom they're going to bail puke get out of the market they're trapped you hear me talk about the instagram retail bus and I explain this in the live example so I'm not going to say it here but there's a reason why it's institutions that are trading on behalf of retail because retail brokers essentially are going in getting liquidity pools in through the institutional market so even those institutions transacting it's actually on behalf of retail so it is generally these will be retailers who are you know getting FOMO or wanting to play short breakouts and we're obviously taking advantage of that so first thing is should make sense to you um I'm looking for heavy concentrations of sellers coming into my area of interest okay so can you see it here look heavy concentrations here selling selling selling and then I can check here on the table as well it's clear delta minus 5 6 1 minus 4 15 minus 5 9 2 minus this is just a beautiful textbook example of sellers really getting aggressive so concentration of sellers and don't forget these are market orders actual transactions so that's point number one and then I'm looking for delta bar imbalances so individually within here can you see the imbalances now ideally I want to see them coming right into this area the interest area can you see that guys 41 people hit market orders not a single person bought serious aggression isn't it 57 contracts were sold not a single contract was bought 180 basically we're looking for a selling frenzy because what these guys they're getting trapped right it's basically absorption that's what it is this is why I wanted you to spend one two three months on the depth of market so when I say absorption yeah easy peasy I know what absorption is it's market orders hitting a level but not being able to get through they're getting trapped it's exactly what you're seeing look huge numbers of market orders but unable to push the market down absorption so basically you could say concentrations of sellers to imbalances basically diagonal imbalances is spelling is terrible on diagonal but anyway so you're looking for diagonal imbalances 189 to 4 you see it's a selling frenzy guys not a single person's buying they're all getting trapped this is beautiful this is exactly what I want to see and then finally so we said c3 there's three things sorry concentrations of sellers which is reflected in the delta right you can see the selling coming in and then nice huge imbalances big heavy selling coming right into the level because we know as soon as we get above this this market's going to pop because these guys have trapped themselves okay and then number three is I actually called it table info in the live example but it is essentially it's exactly that actually table info now what do I mean by that well the delta essentially reflects nicely what's going on in the whole handle and I talked about nice concentrations of selling because you can okay they're selling here but look at this guys minus 455 minus 189 so that's also concentrations of sellers so within here so really the only difference between seeing big selling here look minus 455 is this number delta here represents the entire candle this is just a nice representation showing us there's a concentration of heavy selling at one particular price within the candle let me show you what I mean by that because you may get a little bit confused would you agree look at a candle like this can you see any concentrations of sellers oh they're spread out aren't they look there's a bit of buying here there's a bit of selling there there's some stuff going on all over look at this concentration of selling look at this concentration of selling look at this concentration of buying right look at this though it's fairly even fairly even fairly even can you see no wonder you're getting this type of action then look at this aggression getting concentrations concentrations concentrations so when I wasn't because there was so much going on in that pound live pound example I realized that it wasn't explaining it very well this is what I'm talking about when I say concentrations of sellers it's on and you can make a note of this individual bars within the whole thing I want them to be sticking out like this nicely where it's really showing me that sellers are getting trapped and then secondly is so I'll put here individual versus whole okay so what do I mean by the whole candle I just mean this delta guys because you remember what this delta measures the sum of the whole selling versus the whole buying in the whole candle so don't forget by sellers are getting trapped not only at individual levels but at the end of the day guys market isn't perfect you know everyone isn't selling typically at the same level they're going to be selling throughout are the sellers getting trapped throughout the whole candle let me check the delta which reflects imbalance for the whole candle yes they are minus 592 strong imbalance so that's number one concentration of sellers number two was a diagonal imbalance which we're seeing as well which just really adds weight to the fact that horizontal imbalance diagonal imbalance we're seeing aggressive selling so we're seeing that yep and then table info now I'm not going to go through it here again because of obviously time and I've went through it in quite a lot of detail with the table I'll end up talking for an hour but do you remember what I said to you about delta change is nice to see because we've basically seen ourselves go from minus 415 to minus 592 so not only are we selling we're getting more aggressive okay then look I wouldn't worry about this 234 because we're so aggressive for that to be negative would have to be ridiculously aggressive as it is it's good enough because it's still negative here so you've got to think about the context of this delta change are we delta changing here is this number versus so if this candle was aggressive buying and then I saw this as positive obviously that's different to this being very aggressive selling and then the next candle I want it to be about equal or around there or thereabouts I'm not too worried about this positive change in delta look it's just a little mathematical nuance basically this is so negative for this number to be negative this minus 358 would have to be at like minus 700 guys you know that's just not going to happen the sellers have shown us quite clearly that they're getting aggressive the next thing was a max delta do you remember I explained this to you we want if we're going down we obviously don't want max delta to be very high we don't want the buyers to have ever been in control at any point in this candle is it low guys didn't even go positive once didn't even go positive once huge aggression to the sell side and then our minimum delta minus 358 minus 599 which is almost where we ended up guys this is this is about as imbalanced on the sell side as you're going to get as trapped as traders you're going to get and then the delta percentage remember I said you want below 25 so you'll see when I do the live pound example we never quite get there because the market just has been very thin in the pound recently and I talk about this a lot that's why I want to show you what I look for in a textbook example so obviously I want to see sellers as a percentage of buying and selling to be much more negative so basically across the board you're seeing everything you want so you can just go through these as you're actually going through them so it's concentrations of sellers individual versus the whole candle imbalances diagonal and then three table info all right so I hope that helps guys because I do talk about this a lot in the live pound example as I said and I wasn't quite able to I realized too advanced the example in terms of there was too much going on I don't want to take it out because for the reasons I mentioned when I was actually doing it which is I don't want to show you textbook examples only it's not fair because the market isn't always as perfect as this a lot of the times it is but when it isn't I want you to be prepared for it so I'm going to keep that complicated example in but I'm going to take it out sorry not take it out I'm going to put some textbook examples in later over the next few weeks as I get a chance but this will give you a chance just to see what I'm looking for in a perfect scenario okay so really when it comes to the buying side it's fairly simple I'm only looking for one thing so when we're getting trapped traders guys I'm always keeping an eye on the concentrations of individuals why is that because when it comes to entry I need pinpoint accuracy don't I how do I find that pinpoint accuracy I'm not going to find it if I know based on the table I could say look in theory oh yeah this whole candle it's got aggressive selling ah this whole candle has got aggressive selling yeah that's great guys but if I wait for this whole area to break I'm going to be like getting in the trades after 20-30 pips don't forget these are RENCO candles they represent quite a decent chunk so I'm looking for particular individual price levels micro to help me get in okay so concentration of sellers so would you agree in this candle where's all the trap sellers guys there you go look guys it's just clear as anything that's where the concentration is in here where is the concentration it's clear isn't it see it here it's there so that's what I'm looking for in terms of my entry in terms of my entry and actually as you'll see in the pound dollar example remember this I actually love these areas too and I like to just put in a little line because what will happen is the market loves algos love to test this then they'll pop because these sellers okay so let me take a step back here so we've said here trap traders that's what we're looking for entry what am I looking for one reference point okay and that's going to be this okay so we talked about individual levels guys so what I'll do is I'll mark this level out right what do you think is going to happen when the market starts to go above these sellers guys they are going to bail right they realize they're the last man standing they've been absorbed they've got all this selling behind them this is going turning around they're getting very very nervous okay why do you think it's no coincidence that the aggressive buying was virtually it won't always be as perfect as this but generally you'll see it like here or here these buying are these sellers can you see it's a similar type of level basically they're bailing can you see it's a similar type of level basically they're bailing out fast and you're seeing huge imbalances the other way now guys you cannot deny that is people bailing at this level that's why this level is so crucial so I'll look at this level I'll have it marked once we've got trapped into this zone guys I don't care about this area I want it to come and test the zone then I will look for basically sorry let me just get rid of this imbalances or any sort of aggressive buying coming the other way so one is reference two is balances aggression other way see and because there was so much going on in that live pound example I don't think I explained it as well as I could have but that's what I'm looking for this market to move above the last concentration of trap sellers because I know as soon as we get above here guys this is going to pop now why would it pop because one trap sellers are exiting but two ideally institutions are piggybacking off this okay so everyone is going to be watching this algorithms institutions they're going to be aware of this and as soon as this happens they're going to exit why are they why sorry they're going to enter on the other side why to cause pain because think about it there's sellers trapped here the sellers trapped here the sellers trapped here just because it moves up they're not all exiting at the same time are they look how many sellers guys minus 592 minus 358 thousands of contracts short here just because it moves up say to here only 25 30 40 percent may have exited there's still 60 percent left just think about it got put yourself in their shoes let's say you know when you first got into trading and you know you're like oh FOMO yeah I want to trade the breakout you were probably one of these people who'd sold here as it went against you 10 pips or whatever some people would be bailing right but would you agree some people would wait 20 pips 30 pips and then they start sweating that's what institutions are doing is they're causing max pain you'll hear this a lot it's called max pain it's called pain points thresholds it's these type of areas that's what it is basically what institutions are doing is they're pushing it why because they know as it goes more and more people these people that are left are going to be sweating until they're all flushed out so that's what they're doing they're causing them pain so that's why you get institutions pushing and that's why you you don't get a small pop you get this big pop now what I want you to know is that in the pound dollar example the live example I give I'm going to explain it here because I realized I didn't get the chance to explain as well as I would have wanted to we actually get the market coming back into and it wasn't an area of interest it was more just an area where I felt there were trap traders but this is going to help you understand that much better we see the market coming back okay so what it is is you've got to realize the market loves to leave orders so hedge funds whoever whoever it could be real money it could be central bank whoever they'll be leaving orders here okay for the banks to fill so they'll leave orders obviously these are all the bank's customers they'll be leaving orders here the bank want to go and fill them so they'll typically employ algos to push the market back into these areas and you'll see it so much half the time it'll go but half the time it'll come back and what actually happens is you hear this thing about demand and supply it's all nonsense guys it's not demand and supply what it is is it's trapped traders exiting that break even so they're relieved they're breathing a sigh of relief and that is what happens when the market comes back here you typically get very very very strong support in these areas where there's trap traders so think about it if you've shorted here put yourself in their shoes how many times has the market gone against you say 10 20 this isn't fx it's uh the e-minis but it doesn't matter it could be anything market goes against you start sweating you think oh my god 20 pips down please and then you start praying don't you like look i'll never do this again if you just come back to zero please guys it happens to more people than you think every single day i see it the market will come back into this area these guys that got trapped they'll see their pnl on their screen go back from negative whatever to zero and they should be like thank you and then hit do what what do they need to do to exit here buy so that's why you see the market come back test this area and then boom you'll see um trap people exiting again so you'll see aggression like this but off here so that's all i want you to know is in these areas where we're getting trapped traders so let's say that's trapped sorry sellers or traders yeah you won't always get the move like this this is a nice one because you've got the pop above the reference point do you remember i said i look for entry above the reference here you've got the pop but it won't always happen like that what they'll do is they'll come back a second time but i just want you to know what they're doing here there's plenty usually there'll be orders here um and it will act as support because these people will get out break even there's actually a second thing and it's actually quite interesting these orders may also be some trapped institutions or whoever that is and don't forget um the market is a vacuum for orders and obviously banks are making money filling orders so a lot of times the banks will also want to fill if they're large enough if there's enough people trapped here the banks will want to fill those by orders because think about it if these guys want to get out break even they might have left what orders in the market to do what by so bids essentially right they would have left bids think of your depth of market they would have left bids here guys banks will know there's bids there or whatever or client orders left with the banking desk the institutional banking desk and they want to fill them so they'll just come back and they'll fill them so you'll see a lot so don't be worried if this comes back expect it because you've got your point of reference that's why i love drawing in these little references because when the market comes back i don't worry in fact i use as an opportunity to add you know especially if i see it pop by a little bit and then it pops up again then i know that's a very very good sign that the market is going to go up so i hope that was really helpful this is a lot cleaner because in the real life example i show you in the pound it does get a little bit messy and i just wanted to show you you know in an ideal world what i'm looking for so that's how we get trapped entry is really simple it's looking for the last um bunch of individual sellers last concentration guys in this candle and then i'm looking for the market to just rip up above them because i know they're exiting it's the first 10 20 30 percent of trap traders exiting that's why you'll see this aggression coming in as we already discussed and you see it there as well which i've covered up then typically don't forget we may come back and test it because of the orders to get out break even won't always happen but sometimes it does so you can use that if you've missed the first move use that as an opportunity to get in and then um yeah you'll typically see imbalances and aggression you see what happens on the way down happen on the way up so you can really see it here it starts to kick in where you see you know some serious well you see essentially the concentration of sellers turn into concentration of buyers you really see it here then you see it here you don't necessarily you see imbalances as well you don't necessarily see the table info so okay you see nice aggressive moves there but this is fairly balanced isn't it it's only 58 fairly balanced there and then that's fairly balanced as well the reason that's happening is because there's a bit of a battle going on between buyers and sellers in that so that candle is probably representative of a bit of a candle that's a little bit more advanced i know this because the candle is longer look at the size of that candle it's long isn't it compared to that one and that's typical of a reversal rinko where a bath battle's taking place a little bit more advanced um we can discuss that in the future once you've got familiar with whatever so i hope this helps go through this a few times make note all right guys so that's the footprint section any questions let me know see you later

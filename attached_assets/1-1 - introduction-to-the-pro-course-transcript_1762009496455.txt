Hello ladies and gentlemen, finally we're there, we're at the pro course. I know it's been a long time coming in the sense that you've probably been working hard through the foundation course but I can assure you it will be well worth it if you've done it at the right pace and actually I genuinely meant it when I said the longer you take the better. The more you put yourself, you know, I don't want to lecture anyone, I'm really just trying to help when I say this but any endeavour that you've ever tried to achieve hasn't come without hard work and a little bit of pain. So I know working through some of those exercises in the foundation course were probably very painful. Have sympathy for me, I traded on the depth of market albeit profitably for a significant period of time so I used to watch those numbers go up and down all day and whilst I don't advocate you doing it full time especially now that technology is there and as I said machines are really at the forefront of trading supply columns, us as human beings have a huge advantage in discretionary elements of trading so the sort of things that I'm going to show you which inherently come from the depth of market but present themselves on a chart and so on and so forth so things like the profile etc. But I just want to say so I am going to move on very quickly to the next slide but if you've not done the exercises you will suffer in this section, you know, I don't want to beat around the bush, I'd highly recommend by all means watch this introduction if you're curious to see what's in the pro course, watch this little introduction video but at the end of it go back and do all the exercises, go through the foundation course a second time, a third time if you want, it's really going to help you as you see as you progress through this pro course, if you haven't done the exercises yeah you're going to start treating everything I show you as just a tool or an indicator and that's really going to be to your detriment if you don't really understand, you know, what's going on with the tools because I'm not going to obviously keep referring back to the depth of market, I'm going to go on the assumption going forward that you've done everything at a good pace, you've spent at least three months or so doing all the exercises but again have a look what I'm about to show you even if you haven't and then go back if you've done all the exercises look fantastic well done, you're already much further ahead than most traders, you're literally, you know, you're getting there towards what the elite traders have done at the early part of their career so congratulations but I don't want to burst your bubble but the hard work really does start now as I'm about to show you, so let's go to the next slide now I know I cover a little bit of this with my head I think, I can't actually see myself but I believe I do cover a little bit of this corner but don't worry about it it's just the same slide that we had in the foundation course, my point is just this that so up until now we've essentially covered this part right, I'm sure you agree, I'm just gonna instead of spelling out foundation just for ease I'm gonna put F&E, so we've done foundation and obviously here what I haven't included is we did quite a bit of, you know, business planning, we looked at some of the players in some detail in terms of different types of institutions so you know why you're following this path and why this is the correct path for you but what we're now going to do is we're going to get into the meat of it so that's this bit which is the pro and what I'll tell you from first-hand experience you know I went through it myself is that when you're in a professional trading firm and I mean even the best the best of the best professional trading firms and as you know I even worked in an investment bank which is even considered a higher in terms of institutional levels of trading because obviously they do market making as well and provide markets and so on and so forth but prop trading is obviously pure risk taking which is better for us but my point is this anyway the tools they teach you are exactly what I'm going to teach you so you're going to be shown in this section exactly the same things that you would be shown in you know the world's best institutions wherever those are investment banks proprietary trading firms they're all using these tools volume tools VWAP and so on and so forth and I'll explain why as we go on but my point is this what I noticed is even when I was taught is it was a little bit in the sense that they give you all the teachings and obviously take you through each section depth of market as you know I traded on myself quite profitably for a long period of time so they show you depth of market then you move on to things like footprint cumulative delta volume profile VWAP and so on and so forth but I found there wasn't much in terms of actually structuring it as to what's the right tool to use first what approach to use first so on and so forth so that's what I'm going to do and I think that's where my experience and you know what I've actually evolved as into a trader is really going to come to the fore now in the pro course because as you're about to sleep see on the next slide and the following slide after is I've structured everything in the way that I think is optimal for any trader to succeed so the reason I've said all of this is because I don't want you to think oh Envy's distorted what I would be learning in a professional institution no actually what I've done is I'm giving you everything you would learn in a professional institution and more I'm layering it I'm in terms of how I structure the teaching so the underlying items that you're going to be learning exactly the same VWAP volume profile in fact I'm even going to go into market profile which institutions still use to this day and we'll get into that delta footprint obviously the depth of market which I've covered already but it's what it is is I've changed the way that we're going to approach it so you'll still get exactly the same it's just the way I've structured it typical example is depth of market so you know it's important I say this and just give me two minutes and we will move on a lot of you will have struggled with the depth of market and I get that watching numbers go up and down can be tedious it's painful and you know have sympathy for me I did it for a very long time albeit obviously very profitably but you know earlier part of my career after I moved away from investment banking and I went into outright risk taking I did a long time watching and staring the depth of market and making money from that but what I recognized and what I've noticed that a lot of professional firms haven't adjusted for is that technology has moved on now and machines and it's widely available 80 to 85 percent of the order flow is now machines so they have a huge competitive advantage on the supply side you've seen on the depth of market how quickly it's moving in terms of the supply changing fake bids fake offers and so on and so forth as human beings we just don't have the edge that we used to have 10 years ago and that's shown I don't know many traders anymore that are profit in fact I don't know any traders that are profitable on the depth of market trading manually I know quite a few and I actually have a few friends that make significant sums of money trading in the depth of market using an algorithm so they've programmed an algorithm they're very good at programming and obviously they've programmed an algorithm to read the volume profile and volume at each level and do things accordingly but it's done by a machine that program that algorithm can read in milliseconds the changes that you see in bids and offers on the depth of market we can't do that we just don't have the hand-eye coordination to keep up with the machine it's obvious that's the same in every point in life so what I found is rather than accept that I look now still and I did my research before I put this program together and obviously I spoke to a few contacts that I had to see since I did my proprietary training trader training many years ago to now has much changed and I've really noticed through speaking to people in industry they haven't changed it they still want you to sit on the depth of market for you know 12 months become profitable I did say this before they expect you to get profitable on the depth of market that can take a year as you saw it's it's a it's a difficult endeavor to master and I just don't think that that is healthy for you to be staring at numbers all day it's not going to be good for you your soul your well-being but much more importantly I just don't think it's the most efficient way to become profitable because you're competing against the machines much more profitable way going forward is using discretion use the advantage we have as human beings which is to be able to make decisions based on dynamic information that's coming through in the moment that may be different to think about it if you're a machine you've been programmed by a human being and I know I said this would take two minutes but I realize now this is so important and I hope you agree with me you're not going to get this information anywhere else really you will never read about this in a book you're hearing this from someone who's obviously done this for a living for a long time and seen this first hand so again coming back to my point think about it if you're a machine you can only do what you've been programmed to do so that could be reading bids and offers so on and so forth but as you'll notice I'm going to gravitate us towards the charts and looking at a bird's eye view of things where you can actually start to think analytically you know machines can't do that they can only do things according to set parameters as they've been programmed to do us as human beings the human brain as you know is the most powerful organism not only in the world in the universe which means we're able to disseminate information and change direction very quickly that's discretion so um and that is where I've been able to and I know people who've now been able to adapt because you'll hear a lot of people complain and say oh algorithms have taken over the market no that's not the case yeah they have but you need to adapt let's use them to our advantage let them be experts in their space which is depth of market supply side microscopic taking ticks here and there let us do what we're good at which is having a bird's eye view using our the bit between our ears our brain to analyze things the best way to do that is what on a chart but using value information using volume information not indicators but using all the things that I'm going to teach you and already started teaching you but essentially all the volume profile is if you think about it is what you see on the depth of market which I showed you but there's volume profiles and value which can be a much wider range so not just for the day which you see on the depth of market it can also be for a longer time period and this is what we're really going to get into now in the pro course and why I say the hard work's only just starting because what you will see is different players have different visions of what value is and I will get into this in the auction market theory section but it's really important you understand all of this before I even change the slide because what you should understand is the transition we're making why the foundation was necessary because obviously we had to understand the tools that I'm about to show you and those are really built at the very foundation at the microscopic level but what you also need to understand is you don't have an edge there you have to accept that machines have taken over now you know the technology think about your pc how much faster is it now than 10 20 years ago internet speeds you know data transfer speeds the edge now is gone when it comes to very short-term trading on the depth of market so we really need to take a bird's eye view and look at it things overall and that's where we have an advantage so I hope that made sense I'm going to bring what I've just said now into a visual and that's what I mean is that this is something I've developed myself so let's go on to the next slide I'm going to bring all of that into a visual for you okay so what we have here is we've got the exact same items that you would learn in a professional trading firm a proprietary trading firm at the end of the day ladies and gentlemen you've got google you can google it yourself you know and you will see you're getting everything you will not be missing a single item you're going to learn everything that you do in a proprietary trading firm except and I'm going to show you now how I've structured it in a very clever way based on my experience so you won't find this anywhere else and that's why I think this program is actually much more powerful than you even going into what some of the world's top institutions but rather than me just saying that let me show you what I mean by that so it makes sense let me show you first what exactly you would learn if you walked into a proprietary trading firm so you've already covered depth of market and as you know actually they're going to keep you on that much longer than what I did you're more than welcome to try and become profitable on depth of market but like I said I think that some of these professional firms really need to accept that times have changed as I said I'm surprised they're taking so long about it but it is what it is right sometimes people get stuck in their ways industries get stuck in their ways as we've seen in the retail high street you know online is taking over technology is taking over so here's another great example where you have to adapt to technology so let's not get stuck on doing what they're doing and let's move into really I was tempted to say 21st century but obviously it's a little bit further than that I would say what the new decade 2020 onwards right so if you walked into a firm you would be doing essentially the depth of market as I said for a longer period you would at some stage move on to ultra market theory this is just a little nuance which I won't worry about now but we will come back to acceptance and rhythm it's something I'm going to show you about the market which you don't necessarily get taught but I think it's an important structural element that you're going to get as a bonus you would get taught about market profile which is very very important in professional trading circles volume profile which is exactly the same thing but using volume instead of time but we'll cover all of that so don't worry about it you get taught about the VWAP they do a little bit of fundamentals I don't really use them much myself I love fundamentals you know I find it very interesting to read about economics etc but more for enjoyment to find out how's my country doing that I live in all countries around the world how are they doing that kind of thing I think is very interesting but in terms of actually trading I don't necessarily use it much but I may touch upon it and then what else is there so there's the footprint obviously this is just repeated itself and I'll explain why footprint depth of market and then cumulative delta and then you might do some psychology work you definitely do journaling they're massive on journaling psychology there's a little bit of it but you'll be surprised how little psychology is relative to actually learning because in fact let's come back to psychology on the psychology slide because I have a slide where I just want to talk about psychology for a few minutes but so there's all the things you would be learning in a proprietary trading firm all I've done is I've structured it differently so what I've recognized is the way that we want to develop edge is I really want to build you up from a bird's eye perspective and use all the skills you have as a human being to your advantage so what do I mean by that so look what I've written here developing edge starts with being able to develop a hypothesis for the trading day context so what you will notice if you know any prop trader as they're called who works in a private trading firm any institutional trader has a hypothesis for the day what they will do I do it myself and you are taught this create a hypothesis for the day how do we determine where do we want to trade for the day what's our map context is the map you know if you're going to go for I don't know if you've done hiking before I love to go hiking and you have a map if you don't have a map you're going to be so lost I don't know if you've gone hiking in the woods before with no map no chance you're going to be completely lost so that's what the context is it's the roadmap it's looking at the market and deciding for the day almost knowing several hours in advance where you're going to be going in terms of direction or targets those sort of things absolutely crucial but what I've never seen done before really is organizing it in a structure where all you're doing is learning context that's what we're going to do so basically what I've done you know as part of the G7FX pro course is I've split everything into stages so stage one is going to be looking purely at context and believe me is such a huge element without context nothing you know you can use footprints you can watch stuff on the depth of market and you're going to see the stuff I've showed you before like absorption and so on and so forth it's going to happen everywhere there's no edge there you know you're going to see absorbing you're going to see buyers coming in you're going to see sellers and buyers getting trapped you're going to see all that stuff but you're going to see it everywhere on the chart it's going to drive you completely bananas trying to figure out which sellers or buyers getting trapped is the one that you should actually take account of or use to trade off now that is obviously where you get the birds eye view develop a hypothesis for the day absolutely proof I would say is by far the most important thing that you can develop as a trader so that's why I've created a section and I've decided that the best way to teach you guys is to teach you in the way that I sorry I approach my day so that's what I'm doing context always looking at context I'll spend time on that and what that means is so this is why I hope you can see I ticked off all the things that you would learn in a proprietary trading plan because all I've done is I've taken the individual elements and I've put them into sections so you're going to learn all the same stuff auction market theory market profile volume profile VWAP fundamentals but I've bunched them up into section one so we're going to talk about all these things in terms of developing context okay stage two so this is obviously overall context roadmap of the whole market once we've got that and we know okay today this is what we want to do we want to dig deeper we want to zoom in really to looking at essentially it's looking at value you know I talked about value before and value is nothing magical mythical value exists as you know everywhere Amazon eBay every item in the world is an asset it's the same as the pound it has value so all this is this is just looking at overall value so different players and how different players with different time horizons of viewing value and how we can make that into a hypothesis for the day apologies my writing is terrible there this is looking at intraday value how can we use intraday value to take positions into overall value okay so it's zooming down to that stage two so now I'm going to show you so now I'm going to show you volume profile vwap again but as part of an intraday framework which I'm going to give you and that's where you're going to start to develop edge so I hope you can see how you're going to start to be able to develop trading ideas because I know it's been a long time coming and you must be thinking you know Envy's been making us do all these exercises but this is why I wanted to put this section together so you could see look there is an end goal giving you like a framework it's not going to be a specific a plus b must equal c guys you might as well use technical indicators if you've got that mindset it doesn't exist but I'm going to give you tools where you can start to develop an amazing analytical understanding and start using your discretion to develop trading ideas and actually start getting into the market and testing those trading ideas using a framework and that's very much the intraday value framework which I'm going to show you in stage two of the pro course and then we're going to go into stage three and this is where we've done the depth of market already we'll be looking at footprint cumulative delta so this is a really interesting point and this is another reason I really wanted to put a long section here and I know I've been talking to you for a long time and I apologize and we're nearly done but look it's absolutely crucial that I put this in here because you'll notice I started here and I put module six footprint what I would like you to do is not do the footprint until much later on the reason I put it is because look I accept on my social media I'm showing footprint and you know I don't want people to think I've misled them and they're desperate to learn about footprint so fine go and do the footprint if you really want to but it's not going to help you trade can you see five percent guys it is all about context context is king without context you've got no trades you will see how I trade I've got levels I know if I've got level 100 pips away I don't want to sit there watching the footprint and the depth of market going up and down why I've got better things to do it means I'm not going to learn anything I'm not going to you know it's not going to achieve anything it's just static on a tv it might as well be me staring at static it's pointless all the footprint and depth of market is going to help me do is fine-tune positions depth of market I don't really use anymore footprint I use in the more in the futures markets like stocks and oil and as I've mentioned in the footprint section I don't really use it for currency so much I'll obviously help you develop some hedging currencies without footprint later on what I do use a lot is cumulative delta to fine-tune that's all these things are then you might be wondering well why did we do the depth of market well at the end of the day guys all we did is we built out all the stuff we're looking at our bird's eye view but at a granular level we built back up and now we're going to build back down and that was absolutely crucial why because the building blocks of all of this this section here come from depth of market what you realize and I don't want to get into this here is that all volume profile is on a chart on a big long-term horizon is the depth of market on a chart you might not understand this right now and maybe you do because you've understood what market orders are but market orders are being spit out all the time a volume profile is developing the only difference is when you're developing a hypothesis you're looking at volume profiles which have developed over huge periods of time still come from the depth of market that's why we needed to do depth of market but that's it jobs done now let's actually try and make some you know trading decisions try and develop some well hypothesis as I said edge and we can only do that by now zooming out and creating the road map from which we want to find you in entries so really it's a very small part of the process these things are much more important we need a map first before we actually do the zooming in and figure out exactly you know in terms of exact entry points things like that you know if you think about a good example is if you've got a chart terrible drawing of a chart going up and down up and down you know there's going to be depth of market fine tuning that you can do there you can do it there you can do it there you can do it there you can do it there you can do it there but what if the best opportunities aren't until this section do you see what I mean then you're going to be fine tuning what it's all over the place what you need to do is get yourself into a little section you know of about 10 20 pips in fx terms or ticks in futures terms your areas where you want to be trading and then fine tune that down into okay this is where I'll enter so on and so forth that's what that's why it's only five percent I hope you can see that and that's why if you can avoid doing the footprint section I know it's next I've put it as module six but I've done that because I know people get a bit starry-eyed by all the social media footprint stuff and want to desperately learn it but you know if you can avoid it avoid it but have a look if you want but otherwise I just want you to know it's really not that big then journaling psychology I'm going to add as a supplementary section I don't know obviously at this stage I haven't built all this out when you come to watch this I may have actually built all of it out I don't necessarily agree with how some professional firms introduce journaling and I'm going to talk about that in the next slide sorry the slide after then after next so rather than talking about it now let's just jump to the next slide okay so this is basically my own framework using every single tool you would get in a private trading firm I've organized it you know and end of the day I'm not trying to sell you anything because you've already bought the course so the reason I'm telling you this is because it's true you will categorically you won't find this anywhere else in any professional trading firm they will not organize it for you in the way that I have my suggestion is print this out and have this in front of you at all times what I'll do is because I know my head is covering this and I don't mean looking at a picture of me all day you know it's it's not pleasing for anyone to start their day with that so what I'll do is I'll put a pdf or whatever a picture of this in the download section and I want you to have this every morning you start your day because what it is is I want you to approach the market in a calm and collected manner take a bird's eye view I don't want you to get see all the action and get frenetic as you may have been doing as a retail trader I'm not saying all of you have I don't want to paint everyone with the same brush I'm just saying that if that's how you approach the market it's going to help you take a step back so context we spoke about right it's 70% of it developing a hypothesis for the day that's why I want you to recognize this number is 70% of your job if you can't develop a hypothesis all of this is you might as well go home it's meaningless you need to know what you're doing that day before you even start thinking about entering and all of that is secondary it's tertiary even so you've got to remember context this pyramid I've developed this pyramid I want you to print this out as I said we're going to do that in stage one then the intraday is quite a big element of it but after you've got your hypothesis for the day we're going to start I'm going to start showing you a framework where you can start pinpointing you know if you've got an idea that okay this is where I generally think value is likely to shift today how do you get in you know what how do you actually develop a bit more of a more zoomed in framework because you're doing intraday and so on and so forth so that's going to be stage two and then so this is you know obviously if you're day trading or holding for even a couple of days this is a very good framework for a couple of days if you're a longer term trader you can almost use a lot of the things I'm going to show you here because I know I'll get questions about longer term trading and don't worry as we developed context you'll see that actually you don't need this and you probably won't even need this if you're a longer term trader you won't use this as much you know if you want to hold stuff for a week or longer you'll be using much more of the broader context but even for day trading context and a broader framework is absolutely crucial all this does is it zooms things in for us and then order flow is a very small part of it really I know guys who are amazing at developing hypotheses for the day amazing at understanding intraday context and don't even look at order flow and do incredibly well I don't know anyone who just watches order flow and does well like I said it's maybe 10 years ago okay there were guys on the depth of market when machines weren't around but this doesn't exist and in fact go and google it for yourself the only ones that I know of are in jail now because they spoofed the market so um you know at the end of the day I think proof's in the pudding you just don't get much I'm sure there's you know a handful out there but yeah it's very rare to see people making money on the depth of market or using footprint on its own unless you have the the obvious caveat to that is unless they're using some sort of algorithm that they've programmed themselves or it's assisting them in some way but obviously that's not the purpose of this um pro course or the g7 effects course this is to turn you as an individual into a professional trader and you know you're not going to be using algorithms and machines or programs to do that so definitely no edge there so it's really five percent that's why I want you to have this so it's a reminder to you every day as soon as you start getting too obsessed with order flow and microscopic things well take your stuff back because it's very dangerous to do that unless you've developed strong context both on a broad term basis and then obviously on intraday basis for which I'm going to show you framework four and then you've got add psychology in it's about five percent of it you might be saying oh I've heard psychology is 50 percent guys utter rubbish it's all retail myths rubbish and I'm going to tell you why but just take my word for it for the moment and I'll come back to it I'll add something about this in ideally my opinion you want to not start journaling until you've really understood the framework so understand the framework then once you start developing hypotheses etc then start journaling in my opinion um that's when journaling really comes to the forefront I'm a massive fan of journaling I did it religiously for several years I don't do it so much now but I did my time but I'm a massive advocate of journaling I think it's absolutely crucial part of the process psychology not so much because what you what it is is when you develop edge and you become competent and you know how the market works structure believe me psychology it sort of takes care of itself the reason in retail circles they talk so much about psychology think about it is because it's very clever marketing technique to blame you for things going wrong think about it someone's showing you these squiggly lines or whatever nonsense that you get taught right um which as I've already shown you makes no sense right it's like I don't want to repeat the point it sound like a broken record but at the end of the day when does Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Walmart, Costco, Amazon, Microsoft, any company in the world if you ask them how they determine fair value you know if you say oh why don't you try using the MAC, the RSI they're going to laugh at you RSI, trendline, whatever guys you know it's not used right it makes no sense so my point is this when obviously you're being taught in retail circles those guys know that what they're showing you has no edge that's why they don't show you audited results they don't have there's no edge it's very break-even right or as you know you you win some you lose some so what they need to do is they need to develop something that shifts the blame onto you right and you know this because when you're taking a trade how many times have you been told by an educator or someone else oh it was your psychology it was you you didn't hold the position long enough you didn't do this you didn't do that week your mind go and do meditation go and do this go and do that guys can you see it's it's just a marketing trick it's a it's a mind trick to make you think you're wrong no it's nonsense it's because there's no edge right once you've got edge psychology will take care of the rest not to say i'm against doing things that help you develop a better mindset look you may not know this and don't worry the video's about to end soon but you may not know this but i spent a long period of time in a monastery living life as a monk i've done all of it i've done vipassana i've meditated 14 hours a day i've done all those things so i'm not against them you know i've done them more to more extremes than anyone you know out there so i'm definitely not against that and it had huge benefits for me but in trading you know at the end of the day you either have an edge or you don't yeah it helps to some extent don't get me wrong i'm not saying it's not important but it's important once you develop an edge that's why i say it's five percent develop a true edge and then you will know whether you can implement it or not and if you're struggling to implement it once you've proved to yourself that you have an edge then by all means introduce some psychology but don't don't introduce it too early on in your development stage it's just going to mess with your head and make you think that you're not doing well because of your mindset when actually you're not doing well because you potentially well in my opinion you don't understand the structure of the market you know you need to start looking at what you're actually using to trade and develop edge the techniques rather than blaming your mindset because otherwise you will get into this dangerous cycle of trying so many things but every time they don't work you blame your own mindset and you know you can see you're not going to get anywhere you're just going to go around in a circle so you know what i would suggest is about high time put the psychology to the side and actually start recognizing actually maybe i don't know i don't know how the market works let me understand that first when you get there oh i understand the market okay i'm not able to execute sometimes let me then work on edge okay um final slide and i do apologize a bit of scratching at the door is my dog i've left her out as you know the snoring so but she does get a little bit upset again apologize for that okay so final slide which i'm not really going to talk through i've literally just taken the items and put them on here for you so again i'll put a print out of this i recommend that um you print this out if you want don't necessarily need all this stuff but just thought it'd be good for reference so you can see this is going to be stage one which i'm taking through you through in the pro course which is the contextual element i'm going to show you how to develop a hypothesis the way that i do it then we're going to give you a framework to actually trade the hypothesis and then you can even fine tune that slightly further all right so that is you know something that i've developed you won't see this anywhere else being laid out like this is giving you a very clear path to how you are going to be able to execute from building a hypothesis to executing the edge so it's the full basically path laid out for you in terms of how to go about it order but also importance 70 percent 20 percent and then five percent is 95 percent and then obviously you've got the other five percent which you have here which i'm gonna put in somewhere i haven't decided exactly where but i'll do that so i hope that was helpful really want to wish you the best um you know for the for the rest of the course and you know i'm sure we'll obviously talk again either outside of the course or um i'll do some more detailing about how approaches and how to go about things even though i'm going to be doing more specific learning elements i will have some advice for you throughout the course so um yeah looking forward to get started see you at stage one guys have a great day

Hello traders and welcome to this video where I said we're going to look at some practical examples and I hope you can see I've gone to a lot of effort to record me trading live. Actually in real time I've noticed there's a lot of these courses out there where they'll cherry pick examples and I know it sounds like I'm just being vindictive or something but actually you guys watching this know having done a lot of retail style education courses that that is how it is right they show you cherry picked examples and things that have happened after the fact I'm actually showing you trades that I took in the moment live the reality is that you know like for example the trade I'm about to show you today so let me show you my one second if I get my stats up so you can see my stats this is just the month that we're in so far so 335 pips we're on the 8th today so it's about 7 6 or 7 trading days I've had 30 trades yeah I mean look I've got plenty to choose from you know I don't need to cherry pick the reality is I could show you any of these trades really 4th sorry on the 2nd the 3rd the 6th the 7th the 8th all here at the end of the day I've got plenty of trades I could show you but the reason I like to show you in the moment trades is because every trade is slightly different and that's the point I'm trying to make is that you know so this bunch of trades so I'm going to show you these basically these pound yens that I bought this morning again all real time in the discord of the levels that I show but I could easily have shown you the pound yens from yesterday I could show you some pound dollar trades from a few days ago it's just that what it is rather than showing you hindsight that oh you know this is what I would have done and I will do that where it's appropriate to do that obviously there'll be times where it'll be easier to do that because I can't record every single trade but at least one in every area that is relevant so with the depth of market I did two trades or I think in the moment this one I'm going to show you in the moment and then we can look at lots of hindsight stuff is fine but at least I want to be able to show you trades that I'm taking live in the moment the reason is and I don't want to labour the point but it's a really important one the reason I say all of this is because every trade is different and you're going to see in this trade I didn't follow the textbook there is no such thing in trading as textbook that's why hardly anyone makes it because there is no you know you can't read a book and the answers in the book because it's not perfect every time that doesn't mean that's impossible of course not it just means there's slight variations so again you know I know I'm obviously labouring this point but I guess the key summary of what I'm saying is that I want to show you that things can be slightly different and that can only be shown in the moment if I cherry pick stuff well I can always show you perfect examples so this isn't perfect but what's good about this example and we're about to hit play don't worry you got me for 52 minutes so I'll be doing much more talking so grab a coffee or tea or whatever water if you need to but what is good about this example is I look for a couple so I said that I want to show you what I look for when I'm using the footprint so what I look for is a couple of things and you're going to see both those things in this example that will become abundantly clear as we go on but so I want you to watch this stuff not so you can trade off it that's why I say I don't necessarily think it's you know important that you get live data and start using this to trade and enter trades off it and so on and so forth you can do it do it on demo whatever get used to what is going on and why traders are being trapped but I think it's really important that I take this time here a few minutes to really explain to you that I'm not using the footprint to enter my trades per se I'm watching it but there's stuff I look for in candlesticks and it's not really retail stuff I'm looking for stuff that I've observed in the footprint essentially I'm looking for things that I've seen in the footprint happen but I've watched it for so long I've noticed that actually looking for certain things in the candles I can see the same stuff so that's why I hope you understand I'm not trying to deceive anyone in fact I hope you see it as a good thing that you're not necessarily going to sit here staring at this all day long it's good if you can great I mean it's a bonus I look at it just to see confirmation really but you know at the end of the day I don't really think it makes that much difference the most important reason why I've even built a whole footprint section and I talk about the footprint a lot and I post about it on Instagram is because everything I say is true it is people getting trapped all I'm saying is there's other ways that you can visualize this that I've developed and that's the advantage you're getting of purchasing this course and I did say to you not in an arrogant way but I think what I offer is better than what you get in an institutional education because in an institution they will make you watch this and use this to trade off and I personally think that I've developed use of this but better ways of actually getting you in earlier and there's advantages and disadvantages but mostly advantages for futures this stuff actually is very very helpful things like footprint because the markets are more orderly so it always comes back to I keep saying it FX the volume is quite scarce and it's not as orderly so that's why I've evolved into moving away from footprint for effects but absolute caveat crucial that you understand this that doesn't mean that you can just now skip the footprint you still need to spend a month watching this thing and understanding how traders are getting trapped because when I move you on to away from the footprint I mean you can have it open if you want I do keep it open but it's debatable whether I'm always you know taking the trade with or without it kind of thing sometimes I won't see a hundred percent perfect on the footprint I'll still take it based on what I'm seeing on a traditional chart I don't I mean as you know I don't necessarily use empty for a lot I'm using futures but it's still got candles but I'm using volume charts but I've noticed you can still use empty for and I'm going to show you that later but yeah coming back to my point I still need you to watch this for a good few weeks because when I move you on to here and say oh guys this is what I'm looking for in terms of the chart I want you to think oh yeah that makes sense I saw that on the footprint when I was spending a month watching it now I understand why envy is telling us to do it all right guys so I hope that makes sense spend a month watching this thing demo if you want whatever but be comfortable and relaxed in the fact that I have I have got some amazing stuff that I'm going to show you directly on the charts that will help you with entry anyway because I realize sometimes it's not practical to be watching this thing all day you know so end of the day luck with everything discretion combine it if you want but you know I don't want you to feel I misled you when in a few modules time I say oh by the way guys there's an alternative way that I use that isn't the footprint I'm just telling you that now but do you spend the time watching it so apologies for that long rant but as usual as always I say that you know I'm telling you for your own benefit a lot of this stuff I quickly want to put here some of the things we're going to cover in so we're going to summarize everything that we've said before so there's the delta there's you know we talked about the diagonal uh versus the horizontal so delta traditionally all the table right is looking at it horizontally we're also going to look at diagonal delta um I mean these are imbalances but typically imbalances are talked about when they're talking about diagonal imbalances um so we're going to talk about that and what else are we going to talk about just check my list here um yep the table so we're going to cover this table don't worry we're going to do all of this while the video plays so we can kill two birds in one stone and then we're going to talk about candlestick types as well so I did say to you you know I'm going to show you the huge advantages of this candlestick types so maybe if you want you can make a pause and make a note of this stuff and then the table isn't it delta table I just put d table delta table so we're going to discuss that whilst I hit play okay so let me just get rid of that ball everything then I'm going to hit play so this is actually pound yen I thought it was a really interesting example for the reasons I described before which was that um I'm so often using pound dollar to trade pound yen because there's no volume really in pound yen in the futures market it's virtually zero it's pointless I'm never going to get anything out of watching um so let me just show you what I've done here I'll come back to that point because what I've done here is I want to show you some context we're going to come on to this in the pro course um in detail we're going to talk about context but in the effects market this won't make sense right now but it's important I show you why I was even looking at this level I won't be able to show you a hundred percent because obviously it's a very um complex and deep topic about how I pick my levels but essentially what I'm looking for is value I talked about value on the depth of market with the volume profile well in fx um you can use market profile if you want which probably won't make sense to you right now but we'll come back to it but I like to do it right now but we'll come back to it but I like to do it by by eye so um again I'll try and explain this as best I can later on but essentially forget about trend lines it's not that you can see the market has been building value like this now I'm going to draw this in these are not channels guys they are not channels and I'm even hesitant to put them in I'll take them out I just want you to visualize that because what the market's doing is it's building higher value so this will make more sense when we get on to the next few sections in the pro course about auction market theory we've talked about a little bit already I believe in the foundation course in the dome example section I talked about the price of milk etc it's exactly what's going on here price of milk pound dollar no difference and see I can just eyeball it and I can see little pockets of value I can see one there um and then this is essentially what I'm looking at is obviously I can see value building higher like this it's not a trend you've got to forget about all that what the market's doing is it's seeking value and it's got a certain rhythm to it so the rhythm you can clearly see is it's going like that so what the market's doing is trying to actually the reality is what it's trying to do is it's trying to find value and this will make more sense to you a bit later on so just basically stick with me for now but it's trying to find value in a section so actually that's the section and if you looked at this on a profile that's how it would look we're going to come on to this later that's what I say just just take my word for it now you'll see a volume profile a market profile or whatever and it'll look like this so what it's actually trying to do is it's trying to say okay the fair price of pound yen is unfortunately I can't see that here and I know I'm just not going to bother forwarding that but whatever price that is you'll see it in a sec when I minimize this chart again say it's 134.50 let's just make up that price what the market's doing is it's trying to figure out what's the fair price today for pound yen in the same way the market is transacting you know milk goods on amazon whatever it is and essentially is trying to find value so in my mind I know what I was thinking was that okay I could approximately see okay the majority of transactions over the last two days have taken place in this area now what am I looking for do you remember what I said if we move away I believe the example I used for milk was 140 160 and then the fair price was 150 so what's happening is I'm looking for that mean reversion I'm looking for price to go back into fair value so that's why this area is actually to me a great trading area we went through this on depth of market you remember we went out of value we're coming back in value so I'm going to cover all of this again it's just I want to give you context as to what on earth I'm doing for the next 50 minutes on a footprint right so this is the context element of it and what I'm thinking is I'm probably going to because I haven't actually written the module yet I'm just thinking in my mind how I'm going to do it but what you see is I'm going to suggest that you start learning context first and then you move on to intraday context and then you move into things like order flow so that's this section so actually in the ideal world this is the last section you'll be doing but whatever you know the point is that you need to understand context first in terms of you know if there was some sort of hierarchy you'd want context first then you'd want like some intraday stuff in terms of framework just to pinpoint down the wider context and then you'd want order flow so that's how you'd want to do it obviously we're tackling order flow first which isn't ideal but you know without sounding like a broken record I've wanted to do it because I post a lot about this stuff so anyway so I'm looking here straight away in my mind I'm thinking this is the edge and that's the edge so that's one of the reasons that I've drawn these levels in because I know okay I'm looking for extremes of value but what's actually happened to give me and you can see I've got two lines here you'll notice in the discord sometimes I just have one the reason I've got two is because can you see this edge I'm looking at the edge of this value as part of this move upwards to try and build value in this area this is maybe going to go way off your head right now but just stick with me so my point is as I'm shorting as I'm sorry as I'm coming into this area to fade the market I know I might have to take a little bit of heat that's why you see me often very relaxed in effects you know I'll add won't I as it goes even more against me that's because I know that potentially I could have to go a little bit deeper and it could test the edge of this value but anyway I hope that gives you a good insight into why I was looking at this area it was just a mean reversion play so I'm going to press play now again and there you can see me moving the mouse just reminding myself to explain to everyone later that that's what I'm looking at but anyway I remembered excuse me I'm going to be rude and actually have a sip of my fizzy water because we do have a long session ahead so I had the 15 minute chart open before so I could show you the wider view of the last three four days now I like to zoom into the one minute chart and actually when I'm taking entries I like to use a one minute chart and I'm going to explain this later on I've already decided so you see me there with the mouse this is me earlier I'm circling this area here because I hadn't my eye on that area and I'm going to explain why in a moment I mean we've we've got 50 minutes together so plenty of time so don't forget that on the actually it's probably above my head because I think I'm somewhere here on a bit below this this is pound yen okay because I think I'm somewhere here on below this this is pound yen okay so I'm going to talk I'm going to talk a lot because obviously it seems to be my nature to talk a lot through these videos which I hope you find a good thing but my point is I'm also going to try and take these little breaks because I know I've got a long time to explain things to you so I'm going to be quite relaxed about it so again just to reiterate this is pound futures and this is pound yen guys okay so I'm just using this as a proxy but it's fine I do it all the time it's much more advanced but I thought let me show them something a little bit different because you'll really learn from it because really this example has got everything so you saw me earlier circling this area so it's this area here and there's a very good reason I do that so basically what I'm looking for guys is you can see here right what I'd done is I was looking for 133.60 these levels look wide but they're not it's a one minute chart there's only 10 pips here this area is about 10 pips now I don't really want to get into it but in the morning I had said all right about 133.60 if the market goes down to I'm gonna get long but something over here maybe a tiny bit of value area or whatever it was had caught my eye and I thought I'm happy to raise the price to 70 and actually I know what it was when we came down it was this action here and then subsequent move above it was this that got me thinking maybe this isn't gonna go all the way down this from years of watching the pound in the morning by the way I mean they tend to reverse it they love to reverse this market especially if we've sold off overnight which in this case we'd had a decent sell-off as you saw on the previous 15 minute chart I'm not gonna bother rewinding it you can but I know we'd have had a decent enough sell-off coming into this market we had a lot of people that had aggressively sold and can you see why I love this it's obvious that essentially we had aggressively sold off but unfortunately I don't have that candlestick but this would have shown quite a bit of aggression selling off but that's okay so essentially what I'm looking for and you're going to see this in a second is I'm looking for sellers to come in aggressively okay I want them to get trapped now there's ways that I measure that and we spoke about a little bit before and it's to do with um extreme levels of delta right so we talked about delta so let's remind ourselves what is delta let's just mark it all the differentials right buyers minus sellers so that minus that so unfortunately if you're looking at this on an iPhone or whatever you're probably going to have to go to your desktop I apologize I'm not really going to zoom in on this particular example because I want to keep it side by side with the live chart of the pound yen I know I keep apologizing and caveating myself but I also want you to see this as a good thing what I'm about to say I haven't got any script for this video none of this is pre-empted I have not watched this video back since I took this trade so half of it I can't even remember exactly what I did um but I prefer it like that so I want you to see what my thought process is in the moment I've got nothing written down here I don't have any bullet points that's not how I operate for me you know obviously you can see I'm very very very um passionate is the word but also very um you know my whole life is ingrained in trading this is pretty much all I've been doing for 16 years so for me day in day out I don't really need notes I don't really need to write stuff down to remind myself it's like yeah you know I kind of know what I'm looking for it's just there at the top of my head most of the time that comes with experience it comes with time so I prefer not to be scripted so if it sounds like I'm a little bit all over the place it's because I don't necessarily have a script and I'm just kind of telling you what's popping into my head in the moment I much prefer to do it like that because then you see it the real thinking process of a real you know professional institutional trader what goes through my head um so anyway what am I looking for I'm looking for extreme levels of people getting trapped now in the future this isn't going to happen until coronavirus dies down it could be quite a while it could be a few months before I'm able to give you really solid examples where we see you know readings of delta like uh the uh for example negative delta here is 61 go back to the previous example if you don't know what that means it's just essentially the sum of the sells oh sorry this side right versus the sum of buys so there were more selling here significantly by 61 guys you'll see readings over 100 easy sometimes and delta percentages ideally you want them to be incredibly negative when you're getting into areas of interest so you'll see me I think I do draw a line here a bit later um where I'm looking for if you look here so what I do to compare the futures market to the spot market is right now here if you zoom if you somehow manage to just wondering whether I should zoom into this you should be able to see this on a desktop bar let me just zoom into this anyway there you go can you see that 133.88 so what I'm thinking to myself is all right we're at 88 the levels about 15 pips away where are we here in cable uh pound dollar 123 15 so if we're at if we're like 15 20 pips away what area am I looking for in the pound to get long what in pound yen in terms of the equivalent well it's 20 pips away isn't it in the futures market I mean that's all I'm doing really when I'm comparing the two so I see here that the spot market is 20 pips away from my area of interest 15 to 20 pips where's the futures market oh it's at 16 now approximately 123 so anywhere in this area is where I'm looking and you're going to see me in a moment I'll draw it in I think I do anyway so this is the area I'm looking for now the reason I went off on a little bit of a tangent there is you'll realize it's important so what I'm looking for guys is I'm not necessarily watching the footprint at this stage I want to watch the footprint when it comes into this zone okay and unfortunately because what it is I was quite relaxed you know I've been watching this price action all morning and I could see the sellers weren't necessarily desperate to take it all the way down so I was quite relaxed that's why I didn't draw the line in immediately but you're going to see me draw it in shortly so my point is when I explain you the price action sorry the order flow action or I should say here what what I'm actually describing is what I'm looking for here okay so this example is a little bit more advanced because when I eventually took the trade I saw stuff happening that led me to believe that it wasn't going to come all the way down it's very rare very rare that I won't wait for it to get down but I'll explain to you exactly why I didn't and it will make sense to you but so what am I looking for essentially I'm looking for aggressive selling and obviously if I was selling then I'd be looking for aggressive buying just the same thing vice versa guys I'm looking for this huge selling to come into here and this to go crazy to the downside now because of coronavirus whatever whatever the market's been a little bit thinner than usual in fact significantly thinner than usual so you're just not seeing as much participation from institutions and so on and so forth and you know often I joke that it's the retail bus the Instagram retail bus getting short here and it is but the point is you remember in the foundation course where I talked about how do client orders get filled and this is one thing people don't get it get for some reason is when clients orders are being filled excuse me I'll just take some more water when client orders are being filled go back to the foundation course if you need to when client orders are being filled they're being pulled aren't they by the retail broker what does the retail broker then do they then go to liquidity providers institutions etc institutions etc usually hedge it out so when that is happening what's happening institutions are transacting so really yes institutions are the ones that are selling aggressively but they're doing it on behalf of the retail crowd so the point is if institutions are not active and there's not as much liquidity it also is suggestive that there isn't much participation even from retail and that's what people don't realize they seem to think there's this disconnect it's not even retailers have stepped back in this coronavirus period that's why you're not seeing the sort of volume that you'd normally be seeing the reason I'm describing all of this in details because I know I've got 50 minutes I'm going to be jabbering a lot basically but I will get to the point it's just that we've got a lot of time so I'm just using that to your advantage really so I can tell you what is going on in my mind all the time so coming back to this point so guys I'm looking for aggressive selling we're not necessarily seeing it to the point I would normally like to see it it's okay in trading you've got to adjust and it's good enough it's good enough what I'm seeing here to be suggestive to me that I'm seeing selling so basically what it is what I want you to look for is exactly what I look for so I'm going to get to the point now so I apologize for that so what exactly is it that I'm looking for well basically I'm looking first thing I'm always doing when I watch the footprint is I look at this column here okay now why am I doing that well think about it what is this it's delta isn't it it's horizontal delta it's just telling us the strength of buyers and sellers here okay it's all I'm looking at it's the first thing I look at now what I'm doing is I'm looking for unusual concentrations of sellers or buyers so if I'm looking to get long and we're coming into a zone mean reversion as you saw do you remember this on the 15 minute we came down I'm obviously looking to fade and get long what am I looking for sellers to get trapped because what happens when you sell you sell you sell and then it starts to go against you and suddenly you realize oh I gotta get out of this boom you start hitting buy you're gonna see in this trade that that happens and I'm looking for that that's why if you look back at the my effects book I just posted earlier a lot of the trades when they work properly should be a few minutes well sometimes you can get stuck for two hours fine you just gotta be patient you know not everything goes the way you want it to life isn't perfect and nor is the human mind and human traders they're not perfect they're always doing things the way you want them to do but generally they'll puke very quickly basically they'll crap their pants whatever you want to call it so I'm looking for those people right if we don't have aggressive sellers who's going to be doing that no one so I need those people so what I'm looking for is I'm looking for unusual concentrations of sellers in this case because we're going into an extreme sell-off and I want to see real concentrations of sellers being trapped in the area that I'm looking for so can you see here look at this quite a solid little that caught my eye it's buyers but I'm not looking for buyers I'm looking for sellers so I ignore that here nothing much look there's nothing then I look at the numbers as well it's like below it's in single digits not worth my time can you see anything unusual here no now look at this guys I can see a lot of red concentration so this caught my eye this morning a lot and it's something I was looking for can you see it's a very it's I don't know whether it's just me but maybe this comes with experience but to me and I'm hoping you can see that too it's quite obvious that's selling so then what I'm looking for right guys is I literally like to look at the biggest bar okay and it's uncanny how solid that price is maybe actually it's not uncanny you know this is the beauty of using this stuff versus using indicators that are garbage indicators tell you nothing this is actually telling me sellers are trapped they've physically done what sold market orders remember aggressive selling this is why it was so important you understood market orders they sold market orders and I'm going to get rid of all this okay so you know what I'm looking at now I'm looking at those outside bars I'm looking at the individual deltas within a candle as a whole to see concentrations of sellers within each candle so can you see that clear concentration of sellers it's not that obvious on all bars a lot of bars look at that that's quite even I don't see that you see a little bit selling here a little bit selling here a little bit selling here it's quite spread out this is quite even this nothing really this look nothing and then suddenly but this is why I gave you the long speech earlier about the time of year in terms of you know the virus and stuff and it also can be seasonal as well what I'll try and put examples later this year when the market gets back a little bit to normal but you've got to be able to adapt that's the point and you see it much more prominently in certain times of year when the volume is heavy because obviously there'll be much more FOMO much more people wanting to I don't want to miss out on the sell-off let me sell sell sell sell you see a lot more of that it'll be much more prominent I'm not saying it never happens and I was hoping for it to obviously happen you'll see here I wanted it to come all the way down and actually what you see is I don't end up waiting but I'm going to show you why you see this again it's happening and I was hoping I still haven't drawn the line in that's how relaxed I was this morning because it was taking it was very slow I hope I draw the line in because I'm going to look a bit silly if I don't but I think I did draw the line in around here you see ordinarily I'm not too fussed about watching all of this I don't really care until we get into the area but we didn't so anyway that's part a that's what I'm looking for guys b what am I looking for I'm looking for us when we go down to shoot back up with big buying can you see it in fact let me take a step back just so you can make a note of this this is what I wanted to show you this example to show you it's not always perfect so easy for me or anyone to cherry pick examples so let's do one concentration let's do this concentration in bar bar and it's a histogram right frequency distribution histogram so in every bar I'm looking for but ideally this would be much further down is I'm looking for concentrations where there's a bunch of sellers getting stuck so I saw this it wasn't necessarily somewhere I wanted to trade off but I'm using this as a reference you remember I said I had my eye on this area and I'm going to tell you why in a second so one is we're looking for concentration in bar delta number two is do you remember I said about the diagonal delta ideally what you want to see is you want to see big imbalances here so you want to see red but we didn't get it because like I said we're not really like you see here 18 ratio of 18 to 1 in terms of sellers so there was a bit of crap selling here but ideally you want to see a bunch of them like you see here red but we don't have it here obviously I'm hoping for that as we come down so two is diagonal sell imbalances it could be buy on the other side as well but obviously here we're selling here okay so what is I've always got my eye on these areas when we break out of them firstly I'm going to show you something that I actually used for entry so these are the two things I'm looking for in terms of trapped so trap and I call them the Instagram bustle whatever just you know but that's what I'm looking for initially I need people to be trapped so let's call that my point of reference okay so this is what I want you to do when you're watching this I want you to look for references always be looking for references where can I key off people call it supply and demand in retail circles absolutely rubbish guys it's not supply and demand it's trapped traders I'm going to show you that here you can see me marking it here a lot reminding myself tell everyone I think eventually I do now draw that line in there you go you see it because we're starting to get some selling coming in and I'm thinking oh this could be a nice little aggressive move into here where we see concentration in bar delta like this all the way down two diagonal selling balances sorry I know I'm jumping around all over the place but that's trading right it's not there's no abc don't ever let anyone tell you that you're just looking at abc there's a lot going on and I'm just trying to gather my thoughts and try and order it somehow but obviously as you can imagine in the moment there's maybe 20 30 things going on but I just remembered there's other things there's the table isn't there so number three traditionally and we did see it here I just want to tell you what I'm looking for here when I'm coming into my area of interest so here ideally what I want to see as we go here ignore these two lines just for the time being there is a reason it's a little bit more advanced while I was watching this but as we come into the areas that I use in discord so essentially it's this area here we're still what about 10 pips away look 123 10 123 so we're still about 10 pips away ideally as we come into this zone here concentration in bar delta I want to see certain areas really really prominent and stick out in terms of selling or buying I want to see diagonal selling balances what else do I want to see guys I want to see big delta you can see it here look minus 61 can you see it the sellers what is that sell market orders there's many more sell market orders versus buy market orders the market is clearly selling I'm going to tell you this very quickly because what's happening here is absorption okay guys don't think oh where did that come from this is why I asked you to do those exercises for two three months on the depth of market because absorption is really important to do those exercises for two three months on the depth of market because absorption should be oh yeah I remember absorption that's where what market orders are continuously selling but the market doesn't move so can you see what I'm looking for and why I'm looking for strong um we just changed the bar there why I'm looking for strong delta here why is that because I want selling to come into here right very very strong market orders but we don't move down what is that absorption so I'm looking for this so I'm just going to put here table info or I want to put support but it isn't support in terms of like support resistance you know what I mean by support supporting factors but I want you to go back to the section I'm going to go over all of them again but it's delta delta change max delta min delta percentage so as we come in what I want to see I want to see huge negative delta I want to see a negative delta change from the previous to the next doesn't always have to be there it's fine you know sometimes you might see a selling bar then another selling bar then obviously the delta change isn't going to be so big you can see me circling this area and I'm going to tell you why in a second I just want to finish this point when I'm coming down what do we want to see very little max delta can you see here peanuts and what I want to see huge minimum delta we've got it here and then I want to see very negative delta percentage okay so that those things combined guys massive absorption massive absorption calls trapped mo market orders and that's what we care about because that's real people doing what aggressively okay so now the reason I actually marked this area is because yes I was waiting for this area so you know what I'm looking for here in terms of trapped people yeah so it's one two and then three is stuff in the table which we obviously went through in the last example but anyway so in terms of the just give me a second sorry because what it is is I just want to explain to you why I was watching this area and expecting a bounce it's actually getting a bit bored watching all of this I went on google chrome for a moment there to check something but just thinking whether to tell you what I look for when I buy well I'll come back to it but essentially what I'm looking for the reason I was looking for here all right guys so this is quite advanced I haven't spoken about it before but you've got to think why am I always saying look for areas of reference because what's happening here right and I'll do this a lot when we come into an area we come back up and then we come down and it's not the best example because ideally I would want to see this at my area of interest but everything I look for has happened in this example so for that reason I think it's very good we've come into this area right would you agree these sellers are trapped guys the the mindset of these sellers is okay so they've sold okay the market's going against them what are they going to be doing when the market comes back here you got it exiting at break even okay so what's that going to do it's going to cause a bounce isn't it you think about it how many times have you got long or got short market goes against you and you think oh damn I shouldn't have taken that trade and then what do you exit straight away or sometimes you wait for it to get back to break even and you close it out no loss guys you think you're the only people doing that so many people are doing it you won't believe don't take my word for it watch for it mark out sellers in extreme areas watch the market go up when we come back down you can see I keep marking it obsessively this area here and I keep saying it here you see that that's me in the morning just marking that saying look remind them you're seeing them talking here so what's happening is these sellers at this particular level okay in the pound 123.07 123.08 you can see a little bulge there in the profile what they're doing is they're exiting at break even when someone exits at break even if these sellers sold market goes against them and they're thinking oh my god why did I sell I just want to get out please please please come back to my price how many times have we all done that as it comes back in what are they thinking to themselves relief but how do they exit sell positions buy so what's it going to do exert buying pressure on the market guys I've been watching this for donkey's years and I can tell you I've seen it probably more times than I've had hot dinners take my word for it don't take my word for it observe it whatever you want you're going to see it virtually every single time okay and it's even what I use to do my exits as you'll see up here basically it's like supply and demand that you hear called in retail circles but it's complete nonsense it's not supply and demand it's trapped traders guys that's why I say okay maybe you don't use the footprint long term but I haven't fooled you into I use the footprint but actually I'm not you are learning the very foundation of how the entire market works when you watch the footprint because even if you continue not to use the footprint and say you go back to candlesticks when you use candles to enter you're going to know straight away having sat on the footprint what's going on so what was happening basically on this morning um is it's probably useful if I show you so I'll show you everything I look for in terms of trapped look for references etc etc ideally look for contextual areas but just for learning mark these areas it's a little bit more advanced that what happened the market decided to come down have this little push up come back down and test the previous area and these guys that had sold here relief and thought let's break even guys algorithms know it everyone knows it's happening that's why you're now seeing people coming in I can assure you all pretty much the whole street all institutions algos whatever traders are thinking we're going to buy the pound at some stage they just don't know exactly when um so what I'm looking for essentially is in terms of entry and I might have to take because I think I actually do get along here at some stage okay I'll see if I can just quickly explain it before I get along rather than hitting pause so one what am I looking for okay so I've got my reference point now had this been in this area this is why I love these reference points because what I'll do is I'll mark this reference point out and then I want to see aggressive buying coming in look at that can you see that what I want to see this but the other way now of course because I want to see aggressive buyers coming in what do I want to see entry I want to see all of this the other way once those traders are trapped so I need concentration in bar delta there we've got it look guys can you see anything in this whole bar apart from that nope perfect number two uh diagonal selling balances well what am I looking for the opposite buying balances look you got it there three table info look at this guys huge delta delta change max delta very little minimum delta and strong delta percentage so we got significant buying here and the market moved up that's what I'm looking for the reason I didn't take the entry here is because what guys I wanted the market that to be down here that's why I ignored it but then when we went up and we came back and I saw that these initial sellers were coming in they were what moving up the market was moving up off this sell area this then this is very advanced okay I would suggest you wait for us to move back down here but I hope you can see why I was thinking in my mind was all right these sellers are trapped we moved up they got out of breakeven if I get aggressive buying coming in here what I'm thinking of my mind is not only are these sellers exiting their positions but we're also getting more sellers getting trapped absorption we're getting the street institutions everyone watching the situation and getting long so we're getting that um sorry I'm just trying to think what was I doing here earlier so yeah so coming back to it so we're getting absorption we're getting more sellers being trapped potentially because what look we're selling here but we're not moving down what happens when you're selling market orders and you're not moving down it's getting more absorbing so this has almost now become my new area of reference so I need to find a reference to do what so you see this pop here where I just went 40 but no one sold everyone just bought that was some of these sellers doing what bailing okay a lot of them as I said a bounce waiting for the bounce here but that's a lot of sellers bailing as well so again what am I doing here I'm looking for a reference point here in this candle and I'm thinking right if we get aggression now there can you see I bought I would yeah can you see I'm circling it it's uncanny that I circled this at the same time of discussing it with you I'm actually seeing significant delta change coming in above this prominent area here of absorption so guys I apologize this is a lot to take in I get it but this is why trading is difficult you know at the end of the day trying to think is there any way of putting it that I can make it easier no there isn't I'd be doing you a disservice and can you see now everyone is going to pile in they're just going to pile in basically everyone has seen this what I just described to you um it's a bit of a mess the way I described it but every single person has seen this and I can I'm almost there's no such thing as 100% but you know I'm as close as you can get to certain that this is going to pop very quickly and I actually got in a bit later than I would have liked but that's okay one thing I should have said before is the bar type if you notice how many candles it took to come down here look guys one two three that's where you have five ticker encode beautiful imagine every single one of these was a footprint would have been all over the place impossible can you see it's allowed volume to accumulate as I said many times previously okay so all I've done here is I've changed my area of interest based on what I saw happening here so I've seen sellers getting trapped right but initially I'm not interested because I want to see sellers getting trapped in my areas of interest then I've seen a bailing of these sellers and a big up move then I've seen us come back and I'm thinking well I want us to go down there but actually here I'm seeing the market stalling absorption selling coming in now ideally what I want to see here is two things don't I I want to see so we saw the concentration in bar delta here the selling right diagonal selling balances no not really but I can see 71 now I can see 54 I can see 60 guys there's huge selling here again I appreciate this is a lot of um because again this is the difficulty of trading and I don't want to be negative in fact you can all do this but I want you to see why it takes a lot of experience and why when you listen to all this retail education it's complete garbage it's junk the reason is it's very difficult to package up how to trade in a series of steps it's not can you see this experience because what I'm about to tell you how do you how do I describe that in a book because you see what I'm thinking is and it will make sense when I tell you but in the moment you need to experience this to understand this look at look at how much buying and selling is going on in these candles would you agree it's like 10 10 5 10 5 15 10 look single digit single digits guys look how many sellers are here 60 50 70 that's more than what's in most of these candles huge selling pressure and what's happening markets not moving absorption okay I'm actually circling here because I'm using that as a target you see it was it's not great I wouldn't use it as a trade-off but as a cautionary exit it's the only thing I could find a prominent area of selling why pause this video and think why okay exactly hopefully you got it right what was I saying here the sellers were doing when we came back to it exiting at break-even what do you think these sellers are going to do when the market starts to go back to break-even exactly they're going to be thinking oh the same thing right because at the end of the day the market might have gone in their favor whereas here it's gone against them and they're getting out of break-even what's the same thing it's come back to break-even guys that's the mindset of all traders and it's going to happen here as well you'll see it so in terms of my exit I'm looking at this area that's why I just moved it to this area here this is why I say after watching the footprint for a month or two you can almost move away from it you can keep it on the side if you want I like to keep it there I don't really sometimes I won't look at it it just depends if I'm struggling to get a read on the market then I might look at it but what it's helped me to do looking at it for years is be able to spot things but by using the candles but by going through this type of analysis so you can see here these sellers are trapped that's why I keep circling it huge amounts of selling coming in okay ideally I want to see diagonal selling balances we didn't get it but you know that's why I like picking some examples because they're not perfect you know if I just show you perfect examples and you're faced with this you're going to be like what's going on I'd rather show you difficult examples and then when perfect examples come it's much easier for you so can you see we're starting to pop up now buyers are coming in strong delta change decent delta the buyers are really coming in that's why I'm quite relaxed here now I think I do actually tighten the take profit up because as I said this is a futures market this is a spot market I'm always adjusting we're at 16 15 here I'm looking for just about 20 22 so um what's that about four five six pips so from here it's probably around that area so I'll probably just I think I do adjust it might just adjust it I'm always looking to adjust in my mind but even this move against me I'm really relaxed about it because I know we're coming back into here the area where sellers are trapped guys sellers are trapped in this area so it is very messy but I really don't want to confuse matters more but I don't know if those of you that are eagle eyes noticed that each one of these has value you know how I talk about value price of milk each one of these is individually got value I'm not concentration here I'm not concentration here that's what it is I know it sounds complicated but that is all it is I'm looking where are people trapped for me it's here what do people do when the market goes against them they bail look those guys that's them here getting out then we come back some of them get out break even it solidifies this area and I'm thinking all right maybe this isn't the right area now this is very advanced for you I'm happy for you to just ignore that analysis and no I want to see the area get tested that I'm looking for great discipline don't do it this way it's just I thought this was a great example to show you what I look for you can see I'm circling it there basically I was looking for the market to move up above these sellers why what happens when the market goes against you boom you're going to get out guys so as I said what you saw here was three things you saw one sellers getting out of break even two these sellers taking a loss two three absorbing sorry I cannot write with this thing now guys I don't want you to get freaked out and think oh my god it's too much no don't ignore the fact we're at this area just imagine we're in my area of interest I'm looking for nothing different same thing I'm looking for absorption concentration in bar delta selling imbalances information in my table to tell me people are trapped then I want a reference point and to get long I want the market to move above the trap sellers very simple okay now you really see the market getting aggressive in terms of people chasing it and it will start to come in so what you're seeing is you're seeing people getting out of break even you're seeing sometimes you won't see this bounce second bounce and then a move it's great if you see you won't always see it typically what you'll have is the market will move into my area of interest and then these trap traders as soon as you move above them the market will just go this was the fact we came and tested the area and obviously we saw absorption it was a little clue me in that all right we're not going all the way down I knew I was telling myself envy you know if you want to get a trade in today you're going to have to adjust based on what's going on and that's what trading is all about there you go you see I finally adjusted it because I realized oh the futures and the spot slight discrepancy so there is more here so there's at break even there's people taking a loss right these guys taking a loss three absorption right and then four institutions algos whatever you want to call them big institutional traders algos guys they see this stuff happening so they're thinking like me you see how I got in here a little bit after the turn they're thinking oh I want a part of this boom and it just adds to the fuel fuel to the fire okay so it's not only trap don't always think it's only trap people only trap people getting out that's causing the market to turn around it's also new people coming in who want to get on the back of those people cause them pain you know at the end of the day for all we know a lot of these people you don't get out straight away do you when you sell and the market goes against you you know some people are crazy they'll wait they'll wait 10 15 20 whatever what's going to determine that well how quickly does market move against them so guys institutions algos they know this what are they doing they're causing these people and these people which is who the concentrations of sellers in bar delta concentrations of sellers concentrations of sellers the table is more useful because it tells us characteristics about the bar as a whole because obviously there's going to be trapped sellers throughout but if we really want to pinpoint and we're looking for entry we want to get on the other side of something a little bit more precise so that's why I also look at this area but look my point was guys algos know these people are getting screwed and they have to get out so what they're going to do they're going to push the market against them if these guys are short what's going to cause them pain the market going up that's why you're seeing this market move and eventually you'll see these guys who sold they're just going to be like she's going to pop and everyone's going to rush in okay there's three minutes left one thing I want you to do and I apologize because this video is probably really too long already and I don't want to you know tire you out because you've done a great job um there you go you see it's almost gone up hit the target there was about what was it 12 13 14 pips something like that it's pretty good morning work for uh 15 minutes sorry yeah one thing I want you to do I was saying is if you don't mind um when you get some time just rewind back to maybe halfway when we're moving down here and what I want you to notice is uh I think it was this area we end up forming this whole bunch of candles here maybe 10 15 20 candles and I want you to see how all those 20 candles are two Renko candles and again that reiterates my point from before that sorry I haven't gone completely crazy I am going to finish my point just trying to clear this up like I said there's a long time in the video so so you're going to see the market struggled around here sometimes you know what it does break out it doesn't but that's the thing this is why I take quick profits in effects because you can easily see this turn into a battle where these sellers decide to defend that area so my point from earlier was yeah I want you to see how this bunch of candles form there's about 20 it's a good 10 15 20 minutes and how we just keep coming back and forward from these Renkos and what that allows it to do is build volume and same here in fact this is the most important area and why the Renko gave me huge clues as to why we were absorbing here because think about it I know this is a lot of information but watch this video 10 times if you have to then you'll pick everything up I have to tell you everything otherwise you know I'm missing stuff out I'd rather tell you everything and overwhelm you than not tell you everything and then causes confusion later down the line look here so see it there you'll see the Renko how it's just accumulating market orders accumulating market orders okay there's one minute left so I just want to take a couple of minutes at the end of this video to tell you what I want you to do so hopefully all that made sense but what we need to do is when it comes down so look at it there accumulate then I want you to watch this area here and I believe that's a good 5-10 minutes and right so that 5-10 minute period is just this one or two candles okay so what I want you to see is think about it what I said in the candlestick area the Renko when I was explaining it would you rather see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 whatever how many candles here imagine that on 10 single footprints ain't gonna make any sense to you guys here one Renko can you see why I was saying so powerful because I can see 70 if I had 10 candles if I had 10 footprint candles it wouldn't say 70 would it be like 7 7 7 7 obviously not going to be equal but you get my point be 70 divided by 7 what am I going to get from that info nothing it's just going to be nonsense I want to see 70 all together that's the power of the Renko if that doesn't make sense give me a shout I'll explain it to you again no problem so essentially let's just quickly summarize in two minutes what happened there is my reference point moved up but that doesn't imagine this was my usual reference I told you why it changed because I saw some people getting trapped here and we came back and then we saw absorption a bit more advanced don't maybe necessarily don't look for that setup first but it's good because I've shown you a different setup a different way of using footprint but ideally what you want this area to be is this area here down here so let's say you are coming into my world levels what are you looking for bar delta we're looking for unusual something like this something like this you know prominent areas of strong selling a b diagonal selling imbalances so you want to see these little red selling imbalances like that and believe me you're going to see them at the moment because of the coronavirus like I said there isn't huge imbalances because the volume just isn't there at the moment but in the future I'll try and show you a perfect examples but guys this was good enough because it's a little bit more advanced but you saw 70 50 60 huge amounts of selling coming in relative to everywhere else you know it's unusual it's people trying to push this market down here so in a way you are seeing the selling imbalances they're just not a ratio of three to one but you're seeing huge absolute values of selling okay so that's two three table info big negative delta we saw it here minus 61 delta change was fairly decent not the greatest max delta we want to see that ideally near zero and you'll see that in like I said ideal markets um this was better two or minus 21 something like that but look the negative delta was very strong this ideally you want to see below minus 20 percent but that's okay the other thing that was a big clue is it did sit here for about 15 minutes so it's a good you know clue that there's absorption I'm not going to explain absorption if you haven't got it go back do the absorption exercises and I don't mean that in a harsh way I mean in a polite way if you don't get it let me know we'll go through it together obviously as a group but otherwise do the absorption if you don't get it so people getting trapped so that's table number three all together absorption trapped market orders right got it that's what we're looking for now how do I enter okay so that key concentration in bar delta that key price reference here we saw it here I want the market to move above it start moving above it do you remember the market started moving up bang I entered um somewhere in here I think okay so that was the heavy selling wasn't it there in this area see it there and why couldn't we moved above it boom those sellers that we referenced and figured out here what have they just done the absorbed sellers pop they're getting out so that's what you see there so you want to see the market move above these sellers okay guys so that's all being explained there you know these guys they're getting out um that's moving things up institutions are now goes don't worry they're all seeing this as well if you get the read right they're on your side pop things are going to move fast um go back and watch it a few times if it doesn't make sense I hope that was useful um yeah download the sierra template I'm going to stick that in as well and if you've got any questions let me know I hope that helped see you on the uh next module and just remember guys um you know if this was too much for you and you got confused like oh I'm not confident enough to look for these areas pre where we get forget about this look for this type of action these things and then the market to move above but only in the areas don't do what I did which is a bit more advanced wait for it to come down and if it doesn't come down walk away there's another day there's another hour there's another whatever rest of day all right guys hope that helps you later

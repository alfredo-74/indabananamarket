Hello traders welcome to the next section of VWAP. I know the theory was incredibly heavy and I know it says theory right at the top and I don't want you to get worried and think oh my god more theory. What it is is basically I was reviewing the theory section and I just wanted to make sure that everything that I wanted to say came across and I was pretty happy with it to be honest on reflection. I think I covered everything I wanted to but what it is is it's really important that you understand you know how do how do institutional investors actually use VWAP to trade and what I realized is is a golden opportunity for me to show you that but also to solidify and summarize some of the things that I was saying in the sort of theory section just to just to make sure that everyone got it and understood it. So I'm kind of just going to combine those things together very quickly but this is very much a task section you'll be glad to know I want you on the charts I want you after this to be doing some things and it's really going to help you understand what I'm trying to convey and again I just want to say and I know I said it before look I understand right the theory in the previous section it was heavy some of you probably understand probability distributions and you might have got it fairly well but those of you that don't I don't want you to be disheartened and think lot of maths going on and too much statistics and this and that it's not all right same as I said in the stage one probability section guys just get the gist of it that's all just don't use it as a pure indicator that's all and I meant that when I said the maths you know you don't need to understand it to a deep stage it's obviously important for completion that I show it here but as long as you get the gist of it so that's why I thought when I was reviewing it I realized you know it was quite detailed and in depth I thought let me just summarize things and as long as you take away about 90% of what I'm gonna say you'll be all right just don't take away like 10% and just treat it as some lines and envy says this is what I've got to do so I've got to try and really get a feel for what the VWAP is telling us because that's going to benefit you and look the final thing I'll say is and I don't want to keep repeating the point is that and I said it before if you don't get it straight away it's fine it's something I want and expect you to develop over time okay so the reason I'm saying all of this where I'm going over some of the statistics and the maths is just because when you're actually on the charts over the next few months this is where I want you to end up it's not necessarily where I want you to be by the end of this module even if you get five ten percent of it right now and you work towards getting a larger chunk of it 90% or whatever over the next few months brilliant result that's all I'm saying keep revisiting this just don't obviously fall into the trap as I keep saying of just treating it as a indicator and hopefully over time you know you'll be able to develop the same understanding that I've been fortunate enough to develop and like I said you know at the end of the day this is the honest truth when I was taught this stuff in an institution I was it just wasn't explained and you know this is one of the top institutions in the world two of them this was not explained to me in this way they just assumed I think that maybe I knew it somehow or whatever but I'll be honest with you you may think this is far-fetched but honestly it's true I don't even think a lot of institutional investors or traders around me really understood this properly and they were kind of winging it so you know at the end of the day that's why I say even if you don't get a hundred percent of what I'm talking about you're okay but try to get at least 70 80 90 percent over the next few months so you can really understand and it will help you you can understand what VWAP is so you know I already said the VWAP essentially it is volume profile but it shows the evolution of volume profile but what I really want to move on to now on the task and the thing is we're obviously going to try and look at how do we use the VWAP to trade well what it is is the reason why VWAP is so helpful and I've talked about it being intra period is it's really showing us how the profile is developing throughout the day and what that does is it helps us identify people in industry and in the market profile books I told you guys to read about they do call it day types and that's okay there's nothing wrong with that it's actually pretty fair reflection that VWAP will help you determine the day type so if you think about it it's really useful because it can give you clues as to are we going to be in a balanced day today are we going to be in a I call it imbalanced obviously as you know but if you look I'm going to start to introduce the word trend here but be very careful you know I've mentioned it before I don't mean it trend in the way of retail I actually mean it imbalanced as in value is moving away from current fair value and we're seeking it elsewhere but it's such a mouthful for me to keep saying that I'm happy to use that word trend because ultimately it's just the market is obviously moving away from balance so like I said what I want to do is I just want to quickly solidify some of the things we said in the last section and just make sure that it was well understood now what it is is I'm going to approach it from a point of view of how do we actually use this thing to take positions and actually think about opportunity right so what it is is the VWAP as I explained in the last section is telling us the mean right so over here okay in a perfect distribution which isn't always going to be the case let's say that's going to be the VWAP but that's that's not where we we actually started the day right this is the end profile this is almost like a previous day's profile a previous month's profile a composite profile or whatever actually what's happening as as I said is the profile is developing throughout the day so here we're seeing a balanced day in a balanced day what typically happens well a balanced day follows sorry a sort of a balanced distribution and we saw this with the heights of males and all the stuff we were talking about in 1.4 so essentially what's happening is early on in the day right we're going to start off almost in a balanced state like that and the mean is going to be there right we can almost say that's the VWAP then as the day develops and you'll see more trades coming what is happening here market orders can you see we're just building on top of that where's the next VWAP going to be where's the next VWAP going to be it's going to be in around the same area then we're building as more do you see it's a balanced day then we get more right now we can split this out into initially it looks like that then it we get more volume then we get more volume do you see rather than me having the VWAP there VWAP there VWAP there and having to see all three and at the end of the day I could keep drawing as I could have hundreds of these going side by side like I said it will take up my whole screen it's not realistic I want to see how did this develop throughout the day let me just take one measure with the obviously the standard deviation which I'm going to come back to in a second and just join it up so that's what's happening as the profile is you see more volume builds than we get it's almost developing like that throughout the day so there's going to be a VWAP for every one of these isn't there and actually what's happening is we just join them up and it's very flat throughout the day you know and as this thing is obviously developing throughout the day you're going to get the VWAP in the middle aren't you so more and more volume is building and ultimately through time as market orders come in the VWAP is just going to stay flat okay so essentially what are we saying well we're saying more than likely because you see what the VWAP allows us to do is it allows us to predict what type of day or week or month or year we're likely to have because if at the start of the day the VWAP is pretty flat we already know that price is just doing this right so it's not in a trend is my point it's not imbalanced it's very balanced okay so what did we actually say and in fact let me just redraw that I apologize so I can just match it to obviously what you see here you know we talked about this during ultra market theory and the market is very balanced right what did we say in the probability distribution section we said that one standard deviation right is just a measure of spread you know where we obviously did the variances and then we average them and then obviously we square root them etc I don't want to get into the maths too much but you know obviously I did ask you to watch 1.4 again and I showed you how it's done to get one standard deviation what that tells us is what about 68 percent but let's just round it up about 70 percent of market orders fell within one standard deviation okay now one thing that I've kind of briefly mentioned but I'm just going to tell you here is all institution algorithms institutional investors they're looking at one standard deviation but they're also looking at two standard deviations and I'll explain why that is is because basically all the second standard deviation tells us is so we calculate one standard deviation right either side of the mean we multiply it by two what that does is it captures more of the data and actually statistically all it does is it captures approximately and I mentioned this in the last section two standard deviation 95 percent and look I understand some of you not through any fault of your own because you might it might be new to you you're going to obviously be thinking oh my god this is a lot maybe you are maybe you're not look don't worry about it at the start of my career even though I was a mathematician for me to understand this in relation to markets and how markets were moving like I said I tried to be very perfect so I had my sort of pitfalls that I fell into too and it took me a long time to understand this properly so don't worry I don't want you to necessarily get this straight away I want to use this you to use this as a reference so over the next few months you're trading the VWAP I want you to really develop the understanding from this point of view that ah okay I understand now why investors are using the second standard deviation because 95 percent of all data market orders heights whatever it is falls within the second standard deviation band and I'm going to show you that in a second don't worry we're gonna get very practical in a moment and this will make a lot of sense but it's important I say this about the second standard deviation because I don't want anyone to wonder and think why are we using the second standard deviation band don't understand that basically it's because 95 percent of the data approximately falls into here what does that mean that means that approximately 2.5 percent of the data falls outside of the sorry let me redraw that falls outside of the band the second standard deviation band and 2.5 percent here right 2.5 plus 2.5 is 5 and then 95 is 100 percent so my point is this in a balanced environment where we have a nice shape and we talked a lot about the shape what's the probability of the market essentially printing market orders here peanuts guys 2.5 percent what's the probability of the market sustaining a move in this region in a balanced environment guys 2.5 percent why is that it's only his not historically but up until what it is historically right up until that moment in time so here let's say you're at this moment in time how much of the data has actually fallen in this region 2.5 percent so it's just the probability based on observations and here 2.5 percent so can you see basically when this is happening do I really want to be trading here no I don't because the chance of me staying within this region is very high do I want to be trading here yes I do because the chance of me staying in this region is very low there's barely any chance based on all market orders up to that point that I'm going to stay in this region for very long right there's a 2.5 chance those are good odds I want to take those odds I'm sure you do so that's why people when we go outside of the second standard deviation in a balanced environment algorithms are fading it fading it fading it fading it fading it fading it okay why because probability is on their side why would you take a breakout trade in this environment balanced environment it's completely crazy because what's the chances statistically anyway based on market orders to that point of this going in your favor 2.5 percent would you rather take a 97.5 probability you know you hear a lot about guys talk about high probability trades and I know I obviously do dismiss retail talk a lot it's complete garbage guys can you see this is what probability trading means um you know it's like either you're taking a very high probability trade of reversion do you remember we did this on the volume on the volume profile in foundation course where I said oh you know we saw absorption and we saw heavy selling coming in in this region and I said oh I'm playing it back to the to the mean to the VPOC to the whatever to the VWAP I didn't call it the VWAP at the time can you see guys it's no different you've been doing this in the foundation obviously did you think want to get into the statistics credit because it obviously would have been a lot moving too fast now you're ready you're in the pro section we're moving you on I want you to understand why I was fading the market and remember you saw this just don't get this is my point don't get thrown off just because it's a normal distribution and it's got all these percentages and stats and don't worry too much about that all right we're not looking to become mathematicians however I have to be honest with you that obviously you're now an institutional investor you will need to just have a very basic grasp of don't just do things randomly is my point just because oh Envy told us to do this no I've always said question everything have a basic understanding and I hope this has given you a good understanding of why on a balanced day you're fading the typically the extremes which are defined as the second standard deviation and we can talk a little bit about rhythm obviously we can see if the market keeps bumping its head just below just below just below then it's okay the rhythm then has changed it's no longer the second standard deviation and we can talk a little bit about that but I just want you to understand that in probability terms why so many institutional investors and algorithms and so on and so forth are looking at standard deviations because it tells them in a balanced day you know I told you the standard deviation has this amazing property but it's it's accurate when when we have a balanced environment and I talked a lot about this in 1.4 again so you'll see why this can become a problem when we have an imbalanced day because when we have an imbalanced day what did I say market orders you don't act like this do you start to build volume at an edge and what happens do you see this area starts to build volume and it no longer stays the shape you start to get out of shape and therefore you can't these probabilities start changing that's the problem and we'll talk a little bit about that but um you know again I don't want it to I don't want you to be misled and think oh my god I need to understand this mathematics to a high level you don't look at the end of the day just get the gist of it that okay within the first standard deviation is 70 is fair value so obviously I can use that accordingly to decide if I'm going balanced imbalanced as I showed you in the market condition section but in terms of fading the market I've got a very high probability if I go even out further because the second standard deviation captures what I mean first time deviation is 70 percent if I obviously look to increase the distance and you saw this the number of heights the data of course in a bigger region it's going to be captured 95 of the data all that means is there's a 95 probability it's not guaranteed but it's the best model we have of the world remember I said it's by no means perfect but it gives us a very good idea that more than likely going forward because of what we've seen in the past over the day over the week of the month there's a 2.5 chance that we're going to stay in this region why is that because 95 of everything happened within the bands okay so obviously it's 2.5 percent this side and it's 2.5 percent this side all right so essentially hopefully that makes sense let's look at this as we would on an actual chart all right so let's go to the next slide and then hopefully this will make a lot more sense to you okay so now you can see this is actually crude oil it's the actual crude oil chart don't worry about the color of these things I'm going to talk about them they're these Heiken Ashi candles I don't use them but I'm going to get you guys using them they're going to be really helpful to you to visualize rhythm and I used to use them a lot historically because they not because they have any magical properties I really couldn't care less about any of that stuff there's various reasons why I found these type of candles useful and you know obviously I'm trying to help you out guys out but now I don't use them I don't even use candlesticks I use just black lines because obviously my understanding of rhythm has become obviously much more advanced over the years but I think this will help you to develop an understanding it will help you get into trades and we'll talk more about that my point is don't worry too much about you know the colors of these candles and stuff like that just just notice how similar this is to what I was saying theoretically okay so this is the actual crude oil market recently and essentially it's just going up and down right can you see it's a balanced day guys look at the profile but the profile didn't look at that like that at the start of the day do you agree the profile we talked a bit about this in the last section probably looked more like that and at some stage obviously we can see how the VWAP changed can you see it barely changed early on in the day obviously a lot of market orders are coming in and there's not much data so it's going to be a bit volatile but as things settle down very early on look what happened okay all that means is that the profile as new orders came in yeah we had a few orders here but not many as soon as we came down here it just moved up very quickly and we started building much more here much more here so yeah can you see we had some market orders increasing on this side but generally the bulk of it was here and then here again do you see the market just never went anywhere okay so essentially what we got here the second standard deviation is basically this area here can you see that it's the second standard deviation okay so what algorithm's doing early on in the day they're establishing say at this point they'll know obviously you won't be able to see all of this but it's like that right so can you see the VWAP went up and then it came down what does that tell us probably that yeah early on in the day we built some market orders here but then we came down and we had a nice balanced profile but what happened early on in the day the VWAP was there and then it shifted down as this came in and then it evened out right so you can see that there that's why the VWAP is so useful because think about it otherwise I would need to see this profile split out at that period which is probably that bit this can you see that this period here was probably that bit this period here then I need a separate profile with uh sort of both of them combined then I'd need it for when this part of the day happens I need a third profile can you see how many profiles can you practically have for me to know that the VWAP what probably at some stages up here then it moved down here then it probably moved down here at one stage which you can see here and then it balanced out and then the more we built market orders in the middle balanced out so it may have obviously early on fluctuated and then done this kind of thing can you see that same shape but rather than me having to see so many different profiles the VWAP just allows me to kind of see how the evolution of the day was happening so I can make a prediction on well we've got a flat VWAP and we're just going around it as in the profile's just building on a very balanced level how should I trade this and I'm not going to trend I'm not going to trade it as an imbalance because it's not imbalanced it's very balanced isn't it we already said the fair value you know the one standard deviation so what am I going to do I'm going to look at the second standard deviation which we actually have for us here I'm going to take short positions short positions long positions you see this is where the rhythm comes in is and look the task for you just so you know is I don't you're not going to be listening to me and then that's it we move on and talk more no your task is going to be identifying this on the real market okay we're going to do it together and then I want you to go away and do it so it's very important that you understand this not only a market condition balance imbalance obviously this is very balanced but rhythm what's the rhythm at the start of the day second standard deviation second standard deviation second standard deviation look it changes something changes you need to be able to identify you know I talked a lot about this in the composite section where I said guys we have major edge over algorithms when we can start to apply logic do things from a discretionary basis I tell you it's going to be difficult for an algorithm to identify these type of conditions in the way we can almost a little bit from an analytical perspective obviously where it's clearly obvious they should be able to identify it but at the same time it's like look here I'll give you a good example is we have massive edge because when you program a system what do you what do you say to it do you say oh when you touch the second standard deviation I want you to consider that a reversion when you're what a bit of a price away from it do you see what I mean we can use a bit of logic and just say well what's the rhythm of the market approximately right those two were obvious but look it didn't quite touch it but it's obvious pretty much at the second standard deviation right and here we can say you know what we're starting to build a bit of volume here right which you can see here maybe this market's not interested in actually going here the rhythm is changing okay and then we revert back to second standard deviation so my point is we need to be aware at all times of day I mean to be fair this would have been a much better example had imagine that hadn't happened and the market just stopped in that region and turned around that's why I say sometimes you've got to understand the rhythm of the market because in that scenario you're having the rhythm as 2 SD 2 SD 2 SD and then look one first standard deviation first standard deviation first standard deviation and back so whilst okay we over stretched in this circumstance I just wanted you to see why I'm saying we need to kind of think about what's the rhythm of the balance day so imagine this price wasn't here so my point is this and imagine we were just doing this I hope that's clearer what I'm trying to get can you see the rhythm here is 1 SD you see that whereas if we're doing uh pretty much what we've been doing on this day I'm just going to draw it in myself can you see that different rhythm guys second standard deviation second standard deviation second standard deviation you know the market and you'll notice this the market has this rhythm to it um see I I've heard some guys the way I was taught um rhythm in institutions was more about you know the size of this leg and then the side comparing it and even when we're going up like this this leg should match that leg should match that leg and then retracement retracement will be similar it's kind of useful but I think a much better way of looking at rhythm is more in terms of the rhythm versus um you know the standard deviations and the VWAP because I told you how powerful this thing is it helps you to see how the day is developing gives you massive clues and amazing trading opportunities so if the rhythm is 2 SD we can look for fading opportunities okay so we're going to do this and actually don't worry I've summarized all of this in a table for you which you're going to see um which I'll call like a summary and a trade plan and whatever so I've got all of this summarized um but look at the end of the day I just wanted you to see how institutions A are approaching this and a lot of algorithms are programmed to do this to identify is the VWAP flat okay let's fade let's fade let's fade because what you'll see is when this fade fails so let's say you build here and then obviously the profile shape starts to build here and we start to go imbalanced outside of the first standard deviation and we start to build here guys it will pop because a lot of algorithms and obviously uh locals um day traders intraday investors they'll be fading this market and obviously they'll be bailing so um you know that just goes to show how many people are using this type of analysis in institutions so look I think that's I pretty much showed you what a balanced day looks like and why the VWAP is so powerful because it's a good way of identifying a balanced day a balanced week a balanced month a balanced year and thinking about how can we trade this where's investors perception of value well it's clearly very centralized so every time it goes out they're going to go back to this fair value and like I said we've kind of done this already in the foundation section we just didn't do it from a probability perspective and also from a sort of developing value perspective we kind of did but we did it very much on the depth of market and you didn't actually see any way of how the profile had developed over time and that gives you clues as to not only how the next few minutes or hour may develop like we saw in the depth of market guys how the whole rest of the week or the whole day or the month or the year will develop so you'll see this and the reason I keep saying this again and again is because when I go when you see I go to do this on the week month year and I introduce all of that to you I'm going to go through all of this again right because it's exactly the same obviously I'm going to talk about balanced weeks balanced months but I'm not going to go through probability distributions and show you all of the stuff because I'm just going to assume you know it obviously because like I said this applies to all types of VWAP analysis okay so let's move on to imbalanced days theoretically and then in practice okay so on an imbalanced day let's let's just think about what's actually happening here so on a balanced day right what's happening in the market it's just obviously gyrating up and down and you know market orders are developing right again you've seen this on the depth of market nothing new but what happens when you go imbalanced is you no longer within this fair value zone right and you start to do what you start to you can call it a breakout if you want this is a true breakout where you start to start to build some market orders buy market orders get imbalanced then you start to do this type of action and you know you may just mess around here or whatever but the point is something's changed right now can you see what's happening here market orders what's going to happen you're going to develop volume in this region okay can you see here you can add volume here you're going to start getting volume volume volume building and it could actually get quite thick around here you know if you keep trading here i know it's a terrible drawing but you understand what i'm saying right the point is you're going to build a lot of volume something's changed right so you could in theory end up building a lot of volume in this region and in fact ultimately you could even go on to build tons of volume so my point is look at the shape of this distribution now you no longer you know so all of this is filled up with volume can you see guys you can't use the same probabilities it doesn't work anymore you no longer got a 94 uh sorry a 2.5 chance up here right it's completely changed in fact your probabilities have shifted in the favor of going imbalanced because now all of a sudden your distribution has done what the mean do you remember this i talked about it the VWAP has shifted up here so you've almost got an entirely new distribution okay so this distribution almost becomes like that can you see that you've gone imbalanced you're building market orders there's a whole lump of volume being built up here so my point is the distribution changes all of these probabilities shift to this side to the point where you can no longer say that i have a high probability because look you're not an end of the day you know this is why i say look you don't need to be a mathematician to get this think about it if the price is just going up and down up and down like that you can just logically tell all right do you know what price been going up and down pretty good chance it's going to stay going up something goes like that and then it starts to do this it's not the same is it something has changed this is the this is almost shifted almost entirely obviously your balance distribution is now more like you see it's completely changed it's completely changed different kettle of fished imbalanced day now i talked about this a little bit in the theory section where i said you know obviously we have different types of imbalance and this comes down to rhythm again do you remember in the balance section i just talked about it sorry a couple of slides ago or one or two slides ago where i said you know if the market's moving like you know close to the second standard deviation we can say we'll fade the 2sd because the rhythm is a second standard deviation rhythm obviously i said you know and i'm not going to draw it again but obviously um in fact let's just draw it just for completion if we've got the market doing this it's not a second standard deviation rhythm is it and we shouldn't expect it to be it's the first standard deviation rhythm guys it's exactly the same when you go imbalanced right um so you know we've said let's say the market just starts off in a nice balance and then something changes and we start to build volume okay guys you can either build volume let me just do this again you'll see what i'm doing this again so you in a nice balance something changes you can either build volume here do you remember we said new heights come in or whatever and some data comes in in this region right just above the first standard deviation the alternative is what you could be in let's just say you're in this same balance day right you don't have to build it here you might build it here can you see you're either going to have a lump there or you're going to have a lump of market orders there it's different the rhythm is different in this stage the rhythm is very much a one standard deviation imbalance which i like to call a normal trend right i do like to use that word um just because i find it quite useful to distinguish between rhythm and pace of um i mean i could like to call it imbalance but in terms of when i'd like to identify rhythm in terms of imbalance i like to call it different types of trend i don't know why it's just always stuck i call it normal trend slow trend or fast trend so i don't know i think basically in one of my um early days in the prop firm someone had mentioned it to me as that and i don't know it's always just stuck in my mind i kind of like that term kind of normal trend um fast trend and then slow trend is is here basically where you're doing this but then you start to develop balance very much in this VWAP region basically which is the VWAP here so can you see you're either developing it here you're developing value here you're going in balance here do you see the transition period can start in different regions what it is is the reason i like using this slow fast and normal trend is because it helps me identify trading opportunities and i'm going to show you that when i'm taking trades depending on obviously how the rhythm is i'm gonna basically take it slightly differently so again i want you to be careful when i use this word trend it's not how you think of it in retail trend it's more seeking value but in a certain type of rhythm that's the only reason i like to call it that because it helps me to identify different rhythms so this is going to become clear let's actually look at this from a practical perspective okay so we looked at this in the last example where i showed you this developing right so can you see um you know i'm sorry about this let's get the right type of pen can you can you see where we've got almost this first standard deviation right and in the early part of the day we've got what some volume here now i know it's not perfectly balanced but at the end of the day at this point we've got fairly good even distribution in sort of this region something like that right it's fairly balanced look what happens we break and then we don't come back as you would expect in a balanced day and what happens is the VWAP changes shape rather than being flat like we saw look what happens it moves up why is it moving up market orders we talked about this in the last section so do you see what's happening here is i'm getting this volume here you could almost imagine you know i talked about this in the last balance section where i said we're getting this volume building here you see the profile has changed shape i can no longer use this i can't use 70 percent plus this and 95 percent doesn't make sense because now amount of market orders in the space has changed it's dramatically increased okay so my probability of staying up here now it's much higher okay than the 2.5 percent the five percent or whatever it was depending on obviously what standard deviation regenerate so hopefully that's very clear to you that you know it's so powerful this VWAP and thinking of it correctly because it can help you identify when we're shifting market condition and very much here market condition is within the one standard deviation right it's almost like that's the one standard deviation this is why i don't like to be too precise because you see it did take a blip below and then it just continued up but my point is look once you've identified that this is happening and what's the rhythm here in my opinion the rhythm is very much a i called it a normal trend we're going to talk about this in a second but you see every time it pulls back i can look for trading opportunities yes pull back a little bit further and i would have liked but you know you've got one two three trading opportunities for an imbalance and all of a sudden we're shifting the mean is shifting you know it may have it was obviously originally here but it's it's there as we built you know uh more volume in this region being shifted then we built even more volume then we built even more volume so what's happening the vwap is moving higher and higher it's just the average obviously if you've got more orders coming in at higher and higher prices what's going to happen the vwap is just going to shift you can see here these points are just this point this point this point it's just moving higher and higher and higher the average of each new profile coming in do you see otherwise what would happen is i'd need to literally have all these profiles split out as i said on my chart i won't be able to see it so instead of doing that i just have the vwap and if you think about it when all prices on a day are trading above the average what's happening mark is moving up it's pushing the average with it every algorithm in the world i can assure you given no changes in any other circumstances because as you know i do look at other things just purely on a vwap basis guys they're going to be buying this market okay they're going to be buying this market they're not going to be playing can you see it's just it just makes no sense to play this as a balanced day because we're not doing that we haven't got a flat vwap we've got the market being aggressive and clearly telling us now i'm building value higher i'm building value higher building value higher it's moving up and that's why the profile isn't that shape is it you haven't got a balance look at how the shape of the profile ended up on this day it almost ended up like a multi-distribution right and this is why i did recommend that you read that market profile book because they'll talk about double distribution days and things like that i don't really care about that i care about more what i'm seeing myself i want to come to that conclusion i want a book to tell me how i should trade this day i want to come to the conclusion myself that oh we built some value here in the morning potentially we could have gone obviously in a balanced day but we didn't we came out of it and then rather than returning quickly you know how i play mean reversion trades we didn't the market clearly told us by building volume here in where was it above the first standard deviation in this region we actually built frequency market orders market orders market orders and what happened that meant we changed shape okay we really changed shape and in fact what you can see is we almost just basically built that on this one so you can see all of this becomes redundant these probabilities actually move that way okay much higher probability that we're going to stay up so you can see in practice you know if um you don't mind me saying i think that it's fair for me to say right you don't really need to know these specific numbers i don't care like i said just over time don't necessarily um you know think oh my god envy gets the maths so that's why he's you know does well as a trader it isn't okay it's not that i understood the maths better than most guys in the institution because yeah i was one of those you know to be frank one of the one in ten one in whatever it was that made it in institutional circles it wasn't because i understood the maths because everyone understood the maths okay it wasn't that it's just because i kind of got the gist of it that ah okay what's doing what's happening here i don't treat this as some sort of magical line actually i'm thinking oh as the um gradient is changing i can see the profile is shifting and the probabilities are moving in my favor and therefore i'm going to use this very loosely but i could identify that okay the market is shifting condition it's almost like um i closed my eyes to kind of what this specific line was it was more you know i was almost treating it in an abstract way and i was just trying to almost be fluid with it and just kind of get a feel for okay what's the market doing ah okay market orders are coming in this region and therefore my probabilities have shifted and i've just got a higher sort of chance in terms of if i'm trading this as a imbalance day or a trend day whatever you want to call it i don't mind because i did say when i get the rhythm i talk about different rhythms so let's go finally and talk about rhythm okay it's really important on an imbalance day and i want to just discuss that briefly okay so i want to talk about rhythm and i did say that i wanted to kind of just solidify and you'll understand why i did a bit of theory here because i remember um i brought this in into the last section so hopefully now the way i explain it i'll be much clearer why i did that can you see what happens is basically um i said to you look at the end of the day you want to be able to identify different types of rhythms so can you see here i've written normal trend and i said i like to call it normal trend one sd imbalance so what does that mean well we talked about it in the last section it's like am i building market orders above the first standard deviation so you can see it here so it's essentially this line this is the first standard deviation can you see we've very much got a first standard deviation rhythm right i mean again like i said you've got to be loose with this stuff this was the problem i always said people would be like oh we got a one standard deviation oh it's popped down below and now it's popped back up and they get thrown off by that i don't i just think well approximately it's good enough but yeah you know we can think of it exactly if you want ideally it would be like that can you see that bouncing off the area can you see the rhythm so what does that mean every time we retrace back to the first standard deviation i'm going to get long i'm going to get long i'm going to get long okay so it's essentially this but what i do like to do to distinguish between different rhythms is and it's just a very rough guideline okay don't treat it as gospel is and i have noticed this some institutions they do like to look at the 0.5 okay so all you're doing is you're just putting an increment in there an increment in there because what's going to happen is sometimes the market will have rhythm here sometimes it will have rhythm here sometimes it will have rhythm here sometimes it will have rhythm here sometimes it will have rhythm on the vwap itself and that's what i like to call a slow trend and don't worry we'll cover this i'm going to go through this with you very much this region which is this region here okay um is a slow trend environment in fact i'll say even more than that i'll say so this is the 0.5 okay that's the vwap okay uh so this so actually anywhere really in kind of this region okay so if the ignore this i'm going to just basically just scroll straight over a bit imagine the market was doing this can you see how powerful it is for me to identify this because if i've identified oh the rhythm is what slow trend slow trend okay and that means we're probably building more of a distribution in this region then i'm going to get long here long here long here do you see i'm not going to get long here because more than likely i'm going to take a bit of drawdown no identify the rhythm this is what i mean by rhythm when i'm talking about rhythm and acceptance on that bullet point in the institutional in the introduction and you know at the start of every section where i talk about building hypothesis context crucial guys every start of every day i'll be asking myself what's the rhythm of the market what sort of retracements or sort of balance to imbalance rhythm are institutional investors using to go and seek value elsewhere so you can see here in a slow trend the pullbacks if you want to call them that are much deeper you've got to know that because you don't want to be entering here you don't want to be entering here you want to be entering deeper okay so this is why we granulate this because ultimately this region is what it's basically this region here okay some new market orders are building it's the profile is changing shape okay still very much changing shape and you're getting a lot more market orders happening here and therefore the probabilities are still shifting up towards you being imbalanced but it's just where are the market orders happening so you know where to enter okay one sd i like to call it normal because obviously first standard deviation is considered you know quite a um apologies keep getting that the first standard deviation is obviously very widely used and quite what people like to think of as normal fair value you know we talked a lot about this so um and let's look at that so the first standard deviation is you know in an ideal world it's around approximately that so if we look at it ideally you'd be doing this can you see why it's so crucial once you've identified you're pulling back to this region long there long there long there long there as it pulls back okay do you see that's very different to and i'm gonna basically draw do you remember before we were getting long here here here here do you see it's different rhythm guys completely different rhythm now all your market orders are coming in here they're not coming in here okay so your profile rather than building volume here you might build a little bit but essentially do you see you're now building a lot of volume in this region and you can see it here we've built a lot of volume profile shape has changed right it's no longer normal it's like that it's multiple distributions you're building okay don't worry i've summarized all of this for you that obviously in a trend day or an imbalance you'll be looking for trades in a normal trend environment of the first standard deviation okay and then finally so i hope you can see i'm building you up towards actually taking trades now in this task all you're going to do in this task is you're going to identify a lot of this stuff but finally and this will make sense fast trend what does that mean so this is why do you see on a normal distribution how we've been looking at it so far we've only had the first standard deviation marked but you see here 1.5 i talked about it in the last section this is why i wanted to do this theory just to kind of solidify the stuff i was talking about before now you're getting market orders here so the market is very much balancing in this section okay what does that mean look how far the means going to shift much more um actually what's going to happen is and i forgot to mention this when i was talking about um the normal trend is obviously in a slow trend environment vwap is going to be very gradually increasing in a normal trend environment vwap is going to be rapidly quite rapidly increasing in a fast trend environment why is that because market orders are coming in much further away we talked about this in the last section from the mean so actually what will happen is you'll be like quite an aggressive vwap and um that helps because obviously it helps you identify that okay i've got quite a fast trend environment so basically this here it's the 1.5 sdm what would actually happen is you would now be bouncing off there can you see before we were talking about taking entries here then we talked about slow trend environment which was taking entries here fast trend can you see why is this so important because guys you have to be able to identify this because imagine you identify it wrong and you identify as a slow trend environment guys it's not going to come back it's not going to come back you're just going to be sitting there you ain't going to get in the trade okay this is why so important to identify the rhythm it's almost like what a market condition within the market condition it's a type of imbalance absolutely it's just i cannot stress this enough because like i said and i'm going to repeat the point we'll do it together on the chart if the market is doing that why would you be waiting there guys you ain't going to get a trade that day okay the market's doing that and you're trying to take trades here fine you might have to take a trade there and get a little bit of drawdown and then go up but where's probability here distribution is building value here in this 1.5 region what does that do shifts the probabilities in your favor guys this is probability trading this is high probability trading you know and it's really important right you hear about this all the time guys talk about going to be able to identify high probability they have a clue what they're talking about this is high probability i'm showing you backed up by statistics real market orders people buying and selling and we're just showing i'm just showing you how you get profile shifts right obviously the high probability is going to be where where the transactions are taking place you don't even need to look at this right if the price of an item on ebay suddenly jumps to 300 pounds and that's where it trades for the next month so you know we talked about iphones a lot say they're a thousand pounds in january whatever reason apple has a shortage whatever they jump to 1200 pounds and in february they're constantly trading at 1200 pounds guys you can sit there and try getting this thing at a thousand you're not going to get it you're just going to miss out that's exactly what's happening here you've got to understand where are the market transactions taking place it's changed this is why the vwap is crucial and why i say don't treat it as an indicator you've got to almost think of it from a abstract intangible perspective don't think of it as a line almost i know it sounds crazy but almost try to be the vwap try to be one with it and almost understand how these market orders are developing and what is it trying to tell you and i understand you're not going to get that in one section you can see why this thing is difficult why you know and i'm being frank with you you've paid for professional education professional i've got to give you the truth that's why the failure rate is so high because people find this difficult i know it's difficult but i do believe a lot of that is because they don't understand it properly a and b they don't give it the observation time needed you know it's going to take you time you're going to have to look at a thousand charts i'm not going to lie to you you have to keep looking looking looking looking it's going to drive you nuts you're going to be oh i don't get this i do get it i don't know yes no it's going to be all over the place until it just clicks then you'll be like oh get it now i understand as the volume profile is building because what it is is you know i don't need to think i'm just talking for the sake of it it's not when i'm trading you're going to see this on my chart initially when i introduce you to vwap i'm not going to have this because it's going to be too confusing for me to show you composite profile vwap developing as we combine it with the balance and imbalance condition of composite profile there's already two different perspectives of value intraday dynamic value and static value of the past few days i'm combining it's going to be too much if i start to also introduce this but as you'll see i'm looking at so many things but that's because i understand the evolution and what it is is i like to use this in combination with this and that my point is the reason i'm telling you all of this is because i want you to understand it's a process you're gonna have to develop as you see this thing forming there's no book there's no me there's no one who can tell you guys this is what happens when this happens no you're gonna have to observe it you're going to become i hope you can see i'm taking you 95% of the way there i'm giving you the understanding the tools that everything you need but that extra bit of understanding i can't give you that you have to observe it you have to watch this profile of nothing and then build more build more and watch how the shape of vwap and the bands change as the profile changes etc oh yeah rhythms change i'm going to do this i'm going to do that you see it's it's so dynamic the market is incredibly dynamic and it's changing all the time and this is why i always say to people you know the market will give you clues even after you enter a trade you cannot you're never going to be successful thinking this is the perfect entry and this is where i exit and it's not going to work you know i've said this before many times and we'll talk about this don't worry the last thing i'm going to say is where people set targets right imagine we have just a normal sort of trend right and you've got your target up here then suddenly there's a shift and the market starts to do that right and the rhythm goes from a normal to a fast you know you can't make a decision actually let me move my target higher because market's telling me it's about to go exponential i'm getting loads of volume being built here you see it's very dynamic whereas when you entered did you know this was going to happen this is why it's ludicrous when people say to you you know have fixed targets when you're you're trading value like this you can you're going to learn to become a really really good investor or a trader if you can give yourself the time you need to observe this i thought i just wanted to say that because i didn't want people to look at i know the pace has been really fast and it's been a lot of stuff in the last two the theory section and then this where i know a lot of you might have been like overwhelmed and i just want to give you you know a little bit of heart and a little bit of confidence that look don't worry it's going to take time to develop but if you do it properly the opportunity is amazing so you know i think enough said about that you know we'll see how you develop obviously over the next few months applying this stuff there's obviously still a bit left of the pro course so you know we can talk about that later so what i want to do is i just want to talk to you about very briefly different essentially i call them market conditions obviously but investors typically call them day types so let's go and look at these day types and become clear what i'm talking about so we've already covered balance and imbalance right balance and imbalance are very different what i want you to do now is and again don't worry i'm going to summarize this for you i've got a table which is on the final slide of this i want you to print out when you're doing this i want you to get on the charts which we're going to do together now anyway and we start identifying these these types okay but the point is that look the types of day types i want you to identify really are these are the main ones that um i think most institutional guys that i knew you see in the books they have loads and honestly it's it's a load of rubbish i mean under the day you know if you're going to start confusing yourself if you look for very specific types it's it's very broad okay it's very rough just have the basic types and you'll do fine and you'll see what i mean by this okay because really the market can only do four things that's what i've done here yeah there's variations of this and like i say i see it in books but people try to get too um you know um accurate with these type of things and problem with that is when something that you're too accurate and it doesn't happen either it just causes you to freeze and you don't take the opportunity that's occurring or you just don't recognize it because you're so obsessed with no the book told me that let's keep it basic and you'll see why i say that just stick to these four base types and let's see in this task if you can identify them so balance and imbalance i want you to identify those you can do them but what is is there's also reversal and reversal is essentially um starts off as an imbalance okay it's an extension can you see imbalance look so very much the market was imbalanced right we just talked about this it's above the rhythm changed it went from a slow imbalance to quite a fast imbalance right so this is actually a really good example of a fast imbalance can you see here i want to identify these type of things just get used to it rhythm of the imbalance rhythm of the balance we talked about it second standard deviation um so here you would say oh i see yeah what nb is saying we kind of started off as a you know a slow imbalance then we shifted gears and we went to fast imbalance but the point is this type what happened can you see something changed essentially see the rhythm changed here look started to fail we didn't know right it could have just continued as a could have just shifted and gone to what more of a normal trend the first time deviation but it didn't it broke aggressively you can see how aggressively it broke guys obviously the market recognizes so you saw a ton of sales coming in and when i've got you watching order flow you'll see on the depth of market or on the cumulative delta it just goes whoosh a lot of people got stopped out or exited here algos or whatever the point is not that it's a reversal day okay reversal week or whatever you want to call it what that means is that the imbalance is um changed and we've essentially gone from an imbalance right market balance market to a balanced market look see that imbalance it's a balance can you see that so that's all reversal days in the books i've come out with all these 15 different sort of variations it's all nonsense it's basically keep it simple in my opinion okay it's worked for me my whole career is because what it is it keeps me loose enough to to think about things when things aren't perfectly fitted it's okay it's loose i can use a loose variation of it um so i hope that one's clear so i want you to start to identify where we where the imbalance breaks down essentially so imbalance for the day okay so it's very rough i care about this being very accurate it's rough we had a fast trend imbalance something changed yeah so the way that um and we'll come much more onto this the way that this can be traded is obviously if you recognize something has changed um probably in this region because we built some value and then essentially you know here would have built a little bit of value and we broke you can either just exit you're long or you can get short yeah okay and i've got names for these we'll come back to those but i just want you to recognize that the trading opportunity is a long long long maybe gets stopped out do nothing we recognize it breaks and we're going into a reversal day oh we might be going back into balance so you get short here into a balanced environment take the trade back to vwap i talked a bit about this taking the trade back to the point of control in the composites we're gonna what it is is we're gonna um very much combine this so you might have a multi-day composite with your contextual levels that you've been drawing okay so you can see you can have huge confluence here as it breaks you're coming inside static composite and don't worry we're going to talk a lot about this when we combine the two things you've been doing at the end of stage one and obviously here you're doing in this task combine it all and you'll see the power of different investor perspectives because remember this is a day perspective you know algos whatever are doing this these are going to be longer term investors who see opportunity as we come back into composite value right into this composite value and we can combine the two so you know all investors are now on the same page and we'll talk more about this that's where you identify opportunity and that's true confluence so look i've talked a lot about reversal where we're going from imbalance to balance right what about the other way around where we go from balance to imbalance okay guys you've heard this term breakout guys forget about all this head and shoulder breakouts and this rubbish this is true breakout basically where you're going from balance to imbalance right obviously at some stage the market has to transition we talked a lot about this from balance to imbalance so essentially think about it so early in the morning right you're going to say yeah we've got this kind of rhythm here and market condition which is what balance right but hang on what's happened here we've broken down so here you would be doing what fading the market fading the market fading the market fading the market fading the market right usual balance here you might have faded the market and then in this region can you see we're building a lot of value so you might have got stock tower or whatever you see this isn't normal we're building so much value here where in the first standard deviation so what's happening is what rather than maintaining a balanced profile look can you see we're starting to build up volume here this is the standard deviation 1 SD can you see it there gonna be able to identify this hang on something's changed here something is changing because you see here when we came up we didn't continue to build volume here did we we came back very quickly as i showed you in the depth of market how we trade mean reversion we mean reverted but you see every time we tried to mean revert failed mean revert failed and actually built volume as soon as we came out of this region boom the market just collapsed okay so that's a proper breakup where you go from balance to imbalance and at the end of the day you've got obviously two things you can be doing here and that is you know as with here where you can exit your imbalance trade here you can exit your fade trade you know you might have tried to fade it here and then you've recognized all right i'm in trouble here take the stop and then try to either just call it a day or obviously try to get in when you identify that we've essentially gone imbalanced and we've got a breakout okay so you know guys those are the um day types and like i said i'm going to show you in a second on the next slide you've got the everything summarized for you but essentially what i want you to do now we're going to do it together i think this has gone on long enough so i'll probably do this as a slightly separate section is i'm going to get on the charts i don't know which market yet maybe a bit of both maybe just one and together we're going to identify all of this stuff so we're going to identify obviously balance imbalance reversal breakout but then also we're going to identify the rhythm right so for balance it could be first or second standard deviation obviously with the balance rhythm and then with the imbalance rhythm straightforward right we're just going to do the slow trend which is either like it's building value above VWAP or the 0.5 standard deviation or it's building value in a normal trend above the first standard deviation and or a fast trend where obviously we're building value at a much quicker pace right so the VWAP is quite steep normal trend is fairly decent and a slow trend we'll just do that and so yeah that's what we're going to do let's just quickly look at the summary table and there and that's the end of the section okay so there you can see the summary table and trade plan guys i want you to print this out now maybe you can go through it with me in the when i do the video and i'm going to look at the same way i did lots of composites i'm not necessarily going to do a whole year but i'll see how much um you know i do this quite late at night now i'm going to go to sleep and see how i feel in the morning and we'll i'll basically identify loads of these with you the same way that you did the composite i then in this task want you to just go through and identify and i hope look at the end of the day i used to trade the dome on its own that's why i did live trades on the dome and stuff like that i didn't just sit here taking trades of VWAP that's ludicrous of course not you know at one stage i'm going to show you my chart let's build it up one by one which does involve you having to build profiles go back scrolling do a lot of like scroll back type of work and it's fine it's good for you okay see it for what it is is really really good it will develop your understanding in a non-trading environment then you can really build it without pressure and stuff so print this off okay so we're going to go through like i said um on the previous page the balanced environment we're going to try and identify that i want you to identify that i already said you know the way that you would trade is obviously fading the extremes typically the second standard deviation um imbalanced and actually i want you to i'll put your market condition and rhythm and actually i want you to identify the rhythm here as well even though i'm put it here i do want you to confirm the rhythm in a balanced environment then we've got imbalanced again confirm the rhythm mention that fast trend uh normal trend first standard deviation 1.5 on the fast slow trend is 0.5 stroke VWAP okay um and then the reversal days obviously where we go from imbalanced to balanced which i've also mentioned and then you know i've already talked about this you can exit your imbalanced trade or you can initiate on the break basically of that rhythm going back into balance okay and then finally it's the breakout which is just really doing the opposite so you've got your balance again identify the rhythm even here on a reversal day because you may have started off uh in fact you would have started off right imbalanced and i'm happy for you to call it a trend if you want it's fine because i do call it that when i talk about the rhythm identify the rhythm start early in the day as well and here as well and then this is where the balance fails and you know you've got your options exit the range fade the 2SD fade at a loss and if you can get in on the breakout like we already discussed all right i hope that was really helpful for you that's pretty much VWAP covered we're now going to get very very practical with VWAP and obviously we're going to look at it so what we'll do is we'll do that and then i'll probably talk to you as it stands probably just need to cover off obviously acceptance because i talked about rhythm a lot and then we'll basically try and combine everything that we've learned so far and then obviously consolidate and then but yeah great job so far i'll see you when we go onto the charts cheers guys

Alright ladies and gentlemen, very well done for making it through what was, let's be honest, a pretty marathon session there with the banana market and the depth of market side by side. I never envisaged it would come out as three hours but I'm really happy that it has come out as comprehensive as it has and let me tell you why. This is going to be a quick review and then I'm just going to show you the next steps as you've obviously come towards the end now of the foundational program and this is literally, in my opinion, the most important part of the program because it's going to give you the foundation for all the things that follow, the tools that I use, Volume Profile VWAP. A lot of people will be thinking, you know, I don't want to watch the depth of market going up and down all day and you'll be glad to know that I also don't necessarily recommend that you use that long term but the reason I spent so much time on it is because if I look back over my career and I think of, you know, what's the, if there was one thing, obviously there's many factors that have contributed to my success but if there was one major factor, I have no doubt it was the depth of market. Now I spent many months looking at it, almost a year I think, without the charts. I don't necessarily think that's optimal for you to do that anymore just because I told you the landscape has changed but the crucial thing that I don't think people will appreciate until they've done it is just how much watching this thing is going to give you an understanding of the footprint, cumulative delta, volume profile and mainly these two, the volume profile and VWAP, just because of obviously the way you saw the profile being built and I mentioned this at the start of the module where I said why are we watching the depth of market, why are we spending so much time on it and I said well, you know, it determines how volume profile is built. So you can imagine, look guys, at the end of the day I don't necessarily suggest that you go out there looking for one or two ticks at a time and obviously depth of market is a lot of granular detail but what you need to appreciate and again it's very difficult for me to get this point across until you've been using the depth of market and then you move on to volume profile and you've basically done everything, you will look back on this and you'll be and you'll be thinking to yourself oh the whole market is what the depth of market was showing me over a few prices, the market is doing it over a massive range of prices and I'm just going to show you that in the volume profile in a moment. The reason I'm saying all of this guys is don't skip over this part, it's the most important part of your education because it's going to give you the grounding necessary to understand volume profile VWAP better and I said it before and I truly mean it. If you can get yourself to spend two, three, four weeks on the depth of market, I said a couple of months in the timetable bit, if you can do two, one, two months brilliant but at least get yourself up to speed on some of the things we talked about. So there was the market orders versus, so I'll just write this down, market orders versus pending orders, so that's demand. So I've done a slide after this that summarizes this anyway but let's just remind ourselves of demand versus supply. So demand was the market orders which is the middle column and then pending orders or passive intent was supply right. So again that is the aggression versus passive intent and let's remind ourselves why that's so important because at the end of the day it's the demand side of the equation that's driving the footprint, that's driving cumulative delta, that's driving volume profile, that's driving VWAP. So that's why it's so important to understand aggression but why is it also important to understand supply and passive intent? We're not going to be using this, at least if you want to trade the way I do, we're not going to be using the supply side so much in building an edge. So that means you're off the hook with the depth of market because depth of market is the only place where you see the supply side. But yeah like I said we're not going to be using it but it's so important but yeah like I said we're not going to be using it but it's so important why you understand it is because you need to understand conversely, it's quite funny when you think about it, paradoxically almost you need to understand supply to understand why demand is so important. So what I mean by that is when you watch the depth of market and you watch supply and how it behaves with demand, it should really start to register to you that oh demand is crucial. Supply is all well and good, it's great but again another thing that I want you to understand and I've put in the summary side is supply can be manipulated, right? We don't know how much of supply is actually real, how much isn't, whereas with demand it's 100% real. If you place a trade you've taken risk, you can place supply in the market and pull it. There's always quite a lot of supply in the market, you're never really going to run out of prices to trade at and also the supply side of the equation is usually driven by algorithms and institutional involvement on the automated side. So again that's not a space where human beings, us, can necessarily have an edge over the competition where we can really get really good edges in the discretionary part and so again I would say that the supply side of the equation is much more driven by algos and automation whereas the demand side is again obviously driven by algos but there's a huge competitive advantage we can gain in terms of discretion. There'll be decisions we can make that can be made better than algorithms because obviously they're going to be quite rigid in terms of the programming. They're only going to do or perform as well as they've been programmed or told to do. So really those are the things I wanted to discuss on this page. So we've gone through resting orders, the supply side, we've gone through demand and then obviously as I said there you can finally see what I've just written demand here. Now just the final point I wanted to make guys is look I've literally spent however long it is the last 5-10 minutes talking about all of this. I've spent the entire course talking about all of this stuff. Have I even mentioned a chart? No look there's no order flow on a chart. No supply and demand right? So I hope you can see just how much information you're missing. No supply and demand. These indicators are, I really don't know what they're telling you. They're telling you nothing apart from what's already happened. It's completely ridiculous. As I keep saying throw this stuff in the dustbin you don't need it. That's not to say you don't need a chart and you've seen me I use a chart. I think charts are very useful in particular because of VWAP and I don't want to get into it now but with VWAP being a dynamic volume profile, i.e. being built in the moment, it is actually quite useful to see it on a chart because it develops over time and that will become more clear when we get on to that stage. So anyway these are the things that when you come to practice over the next two months. I want you to watch the videos again and again and again but the main thing is guys is practice. Basically open up your depth of market. Practice, practice, practice. Keep looking at these things. Make sure you understand the difference between market orders versus pending orders, i.e. demand supply, i.e. namely market orders versus pending orders. Make sure you understand the difference and why market orders are the ones that make price move. Why demand is actually the thing that makes price move. Supply can but obviously there's always going to be supply at every level so it's only when demand comes into the market that price is actually going to change. So make sure you understand that. I'm going to try and put some more videos, examples of the depth of market. Obviously when I get time over the next few weeks and months I'll add to the course. Obviously you will have access to all of that. So yeah guys just keep coming back to this. Understand the things that I've mentioned here and I'm going to actually come back to this in just one moment because I just want to talk about the volume profile for a sec. I'm going to quickly summarize this again in a slide and then we're going to wrap it up. So coming back to the volume profile guys I just wanted to remind you of this because you're going to be doing a lot of exercises on your own watching the depth of market. Again don't you know don't spend you know half your life doing this stuff. Sorry about that but do spend a good amount of time say two, three, four weeks if you can watching this and I'm going to put some more examples of the type of things to look for. I might put some examples of things called absorption and maybe some tricks and games going on but for now keep it simple. Just watch your volume profile develop and this is why the banana market example was so important because I wanted you to see how the market will typically trade around a few prices consistently. Now throughout the day value may change but generally especially on range days price will generally be attracted to be attracted to one or two price levels in particular. The reason why I kept going on and on about the banana market is because I just want to remind you that the phenomenon that you see in terms of price continuously building around one or two areas isn't really that much of a phenomenon. It's not really a financial market specific thing is it because it's happening in every market you see. Okay bananas are one thing but go and look at any product being sold in supermarkets, wholesale markets, Walmarts, Tesco, Costco, Amazon, bookshops, any single product does the price not tend to transact around one level and then yeah it might see you see guys what's happening is when it's transacting think about demand, market orders, whenever someone buys a book, buy something, transactions are being made, what's that's doing? It's building a profile guys the price might go up right but then it quickly comes back to that area the price might go down but then it quickly comes back to the area look what's happening guys we're just building a profile around this area. Now don't worry we're gonna I'm actually gonna break it down and we're gonna literally strip the profile apart and I'm gonna show you you know the characteristics of a profile and why they're important in terms of probability normal distributions we're going to get into that in the advanced course but there's nothing like watching this thing being built in real life because you can actually get an understanding of it and what I was trying to say in the other slide is guys you know if I look back on my career watching the profile being built and really understanding that you know when people use indicators they often and I think this is where you need to start really thinking about do you want to make the leap from a retail trader to a professional trader when people are using indicators doesn't matter which and I'm not trying to I know continuously bash indicators but I'm not trying to have a go at indicators in fact I'm just talking generally when people use tools and techniques and obviously they happen to be indicators in this case doesn't matter which one it is they're not you see what that is they're trying to attach some sort of magic power to something that causes price to move what they're missing is what is right in front of them and what they are seeing every day around them in terms of prices think about it guys a financial market has a price in your day-to-day life do you not interact with price thousands of times a day and what I really why I keep talking about this is because this is where the light bulb moment for me was in my trading careers it just hit me one day oh wow price and the way that it's being driven in the real world in terms of demand and supply people buying people transacting at one price volume building in any asset so it could be a chocolate bar it could be fish and chips it could be a curry it could be like we said a haircut it could be gym membership it could be personal training sessions every time someone demands places a market order what's happening guys volume is being built at that price so what do people who supply it start to do they start to supply at that price and what dawned on me was wow this exact same thing is happening in financial markets every day excuse me my dog um yeah so this same thing exact same thing is happening in financial markets every day and the amazing thing about financial markets is whereas in the real world we don't necessarily have access to that type of information right we don't know the sales that amazon are making at each price we don't know so we can't really do as good as analysis as we can in the financial markets so would you agree guys it is a it's criminal that we are not taking advantage of that in financial markets as i'm showing you in the volume profile guys we have that information down to the one sale we have it down to that level it is there on a plate for you if you're willing to put the time in and understand it and if you do the point i was making about indicators and we attach this sort of some sort of magic to them that they are what's causing price the reality is it's supply and demand and it's right in front of us and it's no longer placing reliance on something else it's you starting to use what everyone has the ability to do this analytical ability to actually read transactional data as it's coming through so really getting inside price and that real human element of what's going on because would you agree when we use indicators on a chart etc we kind of get a little bit detached from reality i guess is what i'm saying in the real world um you know i've said this before on a lot of social media videos if you're trying to predict the price of um where goods or services are likely to go in the future and i'll you know keep using this example of chocolate bars but it's true right it can be anything end of the day guys would you use an indicator no you wouldn't you would you would obviously start to think about oh well how many people have bought chocolate bars at one dollar how many have bought them at 110 how many bought them at 120 um what's the supply like what are other certain factors that could drive supply and demand right it's normal you're going to look at those factors my point is that those exact same factors are available in the financial market and i'm showing you how um and that manifests itself in a volume profile and again a volume profile itself isn't any special indicator you don't add it necessarily on your chart from the left it's literally just demand that's it and that's why i say that i use market orders a lot because it's showing you um the demand side of the equation um so that's what i would suggest is that you watch this understand that um and i'm going to develop this what i'm saying um in the advanced course and what i'd like to do finally is just give you a quick summary of what i've discussed and this is what i want you to spend the next couple of months before you even start looking at footprint or any of the other stuff that volume profile vwap and so on i need you to understand these things so this is what i want you to understand guys one so make a list of these things take them off as you understand them okay and like i said i'm going to put some videos over the next few weeks and months as i get time to do this um so i want you to understand market orders versus uh pending orders demand versus supply so this you can get understanding from the banana market obviously video go back over it and just watching the depth of market and saying that the aggress aggression versus you know the aggression being demand and passive intent being supply then i want you to understand the supply side games so if you remember guys where there might be you know 400 contracts on the offer but actually only 200 get filled so obviously 200 were fake so just understand the supply side games that's important because of the things i was saying two slides ago where i was saying algorithms and so on are now very much in charge of the supply side of the market it's all run by computers and i just want you to convince yourself of that when you see the supply side games and how quickly supply can change it can change in an instant so that will just prove to you in your mind that there are games going on but also i really want you to understand that supply side is very important in its own right in terms of driving price and that's why i talked about red army versus blue army at the start when i do some examples watch through them then you'll see what i mean by that but see it's not only games going on supply will also obviously have an effect on price you know if there's a heavy supply of sellers clearly buyers will back off and it will contribute to price falling and similarly if there's a big supply of buyers on the bid side right if the bids are building it's clearly going to cause sellers to get nervous or think twice about selling and therefore cause the price to rise regardless of what i mean obviously market orders will be the ones ultimately causing the price to rise in the sense that they'll be eating if you remember eating through offer side offers or supply on the offer side but the key point is that if there's a huge amount of bids i.e supply side buying that's going to cause what offers to reduce so there'll be that many less orders for what demand to have to eat through to rise remind yourself of what i'm talking about this if it's still a bit confusing go back and watch the banana market example and remember what actually causes price to go up and down is market orders but also the amount of supply so you know if the price of bananas was going to go up once we bought the two i think there was two wasn't there to clear obviously if there's 10 to clear it's going to be that much harder so supply has an effect remind yourself of that with practice and then understand the action around the volume profile how it builds why it builds why um demand and supply may be attracted to one price i talked very much about it before again i'll try and put some examples again later this is something i haven't necessarily talked about absorption and dome games i'm going to try and put some examples of this as i get some time over the next few weeks i'm going to add some videos below then guys this is very important watch the depth of market around the discord levels and sim if you want to i think that's going to be really useful for you although you know i'm not the biggest fan of you going on sim until much later for this particular purpose i think it's okay if you want to start to put some simulation trades just more than anything just to keep you interested because it can get quite tedious to watch the volume profile obviously for say an hour at a time you need heavy concentration so you know if you want to put some simulation trades on by all means do that just to keep you interested don't trade live though guys until you know what you're doing obviously that's going to take some time as per the timetable that we said that you should build for yourself and then look at the end of the day guys you're going to have free access to future trade videos i'm going to try my best to put a few examples as and when obviously i get i'll try and record some depth of market at the same time that i'm trading in the mornings and upload those and obviously we'll let you know about those as those come about it's very much a dynamic course i'm going to try and improve it at all times you know so hopefully you see the benefit of that and then finally and this is a crucial point guys i use uh i've forgotten the software what it's called but one of these screen recording softwares might be snagit i think i've forgotten what it's called but guys even if you work record the depth of market on a screen recorder and then come back watch it at the weekends watch it in the evenings um it doesn't have to be live in fact some of my best learning my best learning happened when i recorded it and then i re-watched it back because you can slow it down and this is absolutely crucial in fact out of everything i would say this is the number one point on this whole slide the most important point is record it even if you do have time to watch it and you don't have work at the time record it and come back to it and keep watching it and you'll notice different things because you saw when i was doing the banana market example guys there was like you know 20 different things going on so obviously until you get used to it and well versed in it you're just gonna not gonna notice everything if you keep it at full speed so slow it down keep watching it re-watching it um we'll try and do some sessions if i can in terms of uh like something on youtube maybe like a big q a with a whole bunch of people and then you know watch it and if you've got any questions then during one of those sessions maybe you can ask but again that's something we'll let you know about as it develops as of the time of me doing this course obviously i haven't organized everything but it's definitely my mind to do something like that to continue the education and help people if they've got questions and then make sure you log your time you know if you decide right i'm going to spend 30 hours on depth of market as step one to make sure i understand all these things all these things guys log your time spent spend half an hour and that's all you can do at a time it's fine i know it's hard to you'll find it hard to concentrate just watching the depth of market go up and down but you gotta stick at it take half an hour one hour take a break half an hour one hour take a break log your time and then like i said yeah have a minimum goal maybe 30 hours or the way i would do it is i would have this as a checklist and once you've understood all these factors to a decent level then move on to footprint until then guys you're doing yourself a disservice so go through all of that um and yeah i guess all that's left for me to say is look i've really enjoyed putting this foundation part of the course together i hope you've enjoyed it um you know i'm happy to commit to you that i'm gonna do my best to put some extra uh tutorial videos underneath in terms of some examples of me trading and so on and so forth but again guys look spend a good month or two going over all these topics before you even start the advanced course and um and then crack on to the advanced once you've understood all these things guys if it takes you one year to understand this that year is going to be the best year you spent and i guarantee you that you're going to come out of it better than most um recruits or trainees at professional trading firms there's nothing wrong with spending more time than the allotted time i've been talking about guys you know end of the day if you can spend two years doing just this stuff and building an understanding of demand and supply and volume profile building on a depth of market you're going to be laughing at the end of it because your understanding i know it doesn't seem like that now but when you come to do vwap and volume and i apologize i've been going on and on about this it's just because i cannot stress enough how important this is to volume profile and vwap that's why i keep going on about this because what's going to happen is when you come to do volume profile and vwap you're gonna if you don't do this the danger is you're gonna keep thinking of volume profile and vwap as indicators whereas if you've got a true deep understanding of how the volume profile builds from the first transaction to the hundred thousandth transaction guys can you imagine your understanding when you come to actually trade vwap and volume profile it's going to be unbelievable you're just going to know it like the back of your hand and it's going to give you this intuitive feel for things that many many many professional traders don't have because they didn't spend the time doing this so forgive me for constantly lecturing you but i hope you understand that i'm doing it because you've obviously tasked me with passing on my experience and knowledge and my experience and knowledge tells me that this is absolutely crucial so therefore i stressed it anyway you know have a great time doing this if you've got any questions file them across obviously can't promise that i'll be able to answer them immediately but i'll do my best to get some answers if not directly then to the community to you but enjoy it and like i said take your time thanks guys see you on the other side

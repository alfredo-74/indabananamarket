Hello traders and welcome back to the final part of the market profile section. As I said in the first part I was either going to split out the first and the second half or do the second half separately. Obviously the first half ended up being about two and a half hours but I hope you agree it was necessary. You know you needed to understand obviously the trading hours, why I look at the markets I do, what the market profile is, why I even use market profile, so all of that needed to be covered thoroughly. So hopefully you've got a really good idea now of why that's happened but look it's pretty exciting now, we're going to get you on the charts. This is very much task one of the pro course so I'm going to get you on the charts so you know let's get you doing some exercises and get you actually building some practical knowledge of all the theory and let's get you putting that theory into action you know which is why we're all here isn't it ultimately to make business decisions and see if we can develop some edge. So this is very much I was going to say the first phase but it isn't necessarily the first phase is it because you've done a great amount of work already on the depth of market so really that was the first phase but this is really the main first phase on a chart and very much you know if you decide to follow obviously the path that I've followed then very much the rest of your career is starting here because we move away from the depth of market and just get you on the charts now so but what I'm going to do is essentially is I'm going to make this the final part of the context section so it's important I say this here is that that doesn't mean that VWAP, Fundamentals and this bit Acceptance and Rhythm don't form part of context they very much do but what it is is I've recognised that this section at least in terms of hours of learning and theory and now this little bit of practice I think it's enough for this particular section and what I really want to do is you see because the problem is when you come to look at the market from a little bit more of a because what you'll notice is with the market profile when we do composite structure as you see I already started talking about I'm looking at a week I'm looking at several days do you remember I said the weekly profile you know it gives us some problems and therefore obviously by default the fact that I'm looking even at a weekly I'm clearly not looking at just one day by doing composites I'm obviously trying to look for balance areas over multiple days so the problem comes is when you go to do intraday analysis i.e. using VWAP on an intraday there is going to be some overlap with this section and actually you see it will make sense when I didn't really want to get too far ahead but I kind of have to just to explain to you why I'm cutting at least in terms of the learning why I'm moving some of this stuff to stage 2 at least in terms of the modules but really I'll be honest with you this what you're about to see you know how I combine profiles is pretty much the foundation of everything I do for the reasons that you saw in Auction Market Theory I'm looking for balance areas and obviously it will vary and I'll explain this depending on your horizon if you're a longer term investor your composites are going to be obviously much larger than someone like me who's more an intraday trader but you know we can discuss that so let's go to the next slide and then finish off part B. Okay so like I said very much I'm going to be getting you to be very hands-on as soon as this particular section of me talking finishes I'm going to get you on the charts doing composites it's going to be really exciting for you to really get your feet wet really and get stuck in but before I do that obviously there's some things it's going to be very helpful for you to understand some of the pitfalls you may face as you're doing this task because you know with the depth of market obviously the task wasn't necessarily to get you to look for trading opportunities was it it's not something I want you doing for the rest of your life in fact I don't want you doing it anymore that's it done if you've done the three four months that I asked you to do you know you should be incredibly competent at the things I wanted you to learn the absorption market orders versus pending orders you know fake bids and offers and just understanding how volume profile develops right because if you've done all of that it's really going to be you know helpful for you and you're going to be so far ahead of anyone else in a professional firm who starts looking at profile because you've put in that time watching how profile develops and you'll notice you'll be able to the more time you put in the market watching profile develop I know it's a bit boring because you weren't necessarily looking to make money but there's a very good reason why I didn't want you to get obsessive over making money and it will only become much more apparent later you know it's to do with obviously algos and lack of opportunity and I don't mean to waste your time doing something that isn't going to get you anywhere and you know I said that before and I don't want to go off topic here but it's important I say it but I'm seeing it increasingly as algorithms are obviously becoming more and more part of the market almost 80% now and heavily dominating the depth of market supply columns there's just no opportunities anymore for individuals like there used to be and I've said it before it's very sad for me to see even professional firms just continually try to do something that isn't working anymore and that's why I don't want you to fall into that trap you know that's where my experience is really going to help you because I'm trying to just get you looking at it and I know I've said this multiple times before but it's just because I know some of you will have been looking at the depth of market for the first time and think no I don't want to get away from that because it's amazing but believe me what you're about to do now is 10 times more amazing and infinitely more powerful and you'll see that and which actually leads me on to my next point so why what is it what are we actually looking for when we're building these composites well if you think back to the section where I got you to do some of the exercises on the depth of market and I've explained this a lot during auction market theory that really what is the market no matter what perspective you're looking at it from it is the depth of market right I got you on a depth of market for what intraday one day if you think of a market profile you know I've shown you this obviously in all the sections but in particular the last section it's just profiles over a period of time but whether that volume profile on the left is microscopic like I said where on the dome it is it's very tick by tick or whether you're looking at it from a bird's eye view it's the same thing so why do I say that because in that section what did I get you guys to do you know I said that we're looking for either the market to return back to value or move away from value i.e. mean reversion or you know go out of mean reversion and move to a different part of the profile but what we're going to do is we're actually going to define that now and we've already defined it balance and imbalance right so that's basically all we're doing but we're just doing it from a wider lens and I'll explain why we do that in a moment but and I have explained it many times you know as I've said it's to do with taking advantage of the edge that we as human beings can develop and you'll very much see that when we're building composite profiles because as I show you it's very difficult for an algorithm to do what we're about to do and this is an incredible opportunity for us to build alpha which is something I recognised early on in my career but I'll come back to that in a moment because I do want to just come back to this first point about why why are we actually looking at this stuff you know why are we even combining profiles why are we looking at what we're about to do and how does that give us trading opportunity so coming back to what I had mentioned before in the Believer's Module 4 where I got you doing exercises on depth of market profile do you remember all it was the profile was very microscopic you could almost see 10,313 contracts etc so I just made that up but you know what I mean and then the profile would be what would be very thin here and then it would sometimes bulge out here and you know I'm just making it up but this is a typical shape you might have and then do you remember the market was on this would be your four columns but obviously it's just a chart isn't it chart four columns whatever I'm not going to draw out the four columns here but essentially let's say the market was trading in this region and then what it would pop out and then we might get some what absorption and etc etc and then we'd come back wouldn't we and go into so you'd already have what balance here right can you see it's just balanced the way we've been talking about it this you only know is the depth of market because I told you for all you know this could be volume profile for a week could be volume profile for a month could be volume profile for a day you don't know that and these could just be value area lines for any period you don't know but do you see what we were doing now when I was trading the depth of market I didn't talk too much about value areas back then because can you see I didn't want to confuse you I wanted to do the whole ultra market theory section first so you understood about balance and imbalance but do you remember what happened in the treasury example the market popped out I saw absorption aggression coming into sell and where did I say we'd go back to balance so that's all that was happening what was the alternative that could have happened here just get rid of this bear with me okay so what was the alternative the alternative was that we had this area balance right and probably here we'd had balance earlier on in the day and then we popped up there so it's a terrible drawing but let me just even this out actually sorry about this prefer to be accurate rather than confuse anyone this may have been earlier on in the day in the treasury market and then we popped up do you remember single prints do you remember how I said in the last part a if the market comes down very quickly the single prints that's all that is where you get thin profiles with the single prints I thought I just mentioned that because it was there but we'll come back to that if that confused you don't worry but I did mention it in part a but anyway so we come back to here and I said the first example was what that we broke above value and I saw the absorption coming in and you remember I said return to value well what was the alternative right the alternative was that we went up broke out but we never returned we never saw absorption in fact either absorption came in and it failed ie the people who got short got run over and they had to bail and they started getting long or we start to see value and then we go imbalanced okay so can you see what's actually happening here either we're looking for enough and I said this to you in module 4 you may or may not have remembered I know it was a long time ago I said are we looking for different areas of balance in a different area to target well do you see on a depth of market it's very difficult for me to explain that to you because as you remember when I showed you the market profile over multiple days do you see now why I said that the depth of market targets could be away on a different day so that's why we I've you know obviously started to take a bird's eye view because it allows me to see if the market goes imbalanced where's the next area of balance so do you remember that essentially we've discussed this to death really but that the market is balancing and then it's imbalancing then it balances and then it imbalances right that's all it's doing all day long why is that well it's got value here it's got value here it's got you know obviously value somewhere else and I'm not going to repeat this again and again because we have covered this quite thoroughly in Ultra Market Theory so I'm going to skim over this very quickly but the reason why this is important is because there's only two things that's the point of me explaining all of this again to you is guys you've got to understand there's only two things that the market is ever doing and that is either balancing or it's imbalancing and looking for different areas of value and we talked about this a million times with bread do you remember with chocolate with however many milk whatever example I gave so I'm not going to discuss it here again but I just want to remind you that there is no other conditions apart from balance and imbalance and in fact I want to mention this here because look I mentioned it here market conditioned balance and imbalance but I don't know if you you know some of you are from a retail background you know it's not like this is never mentioned you must have heard this before where people say the markets in a range or the market is not in a range you know and you need to be very good at identifying when the market is in a range and you see indicators and I'm not going to bash them but I'm going to tell you you know very politely as in logically look think about it yourself indicators don't tell you when the market is balanced or imbalanced when the markets ranging or not ranging think about it all these I mean you know what I think of them but moving averages and things why do you think they don't work they only work well in imbalanced environments right trendy when the markets balanced and guys you've got to understand 80% of the time the markets in balance and you know I've talked about this when the market was very volatile during coronavirus and other volatile periods I've said to you institutions aren't involved and I've showed you on the depth of market you're so thin why do you think that is because market because what it is is professional players institutions banks whoever whatever you want to call them hedge funds basically very active speculative players that are responsible for the bulk of volume the reason why the depth disappears is because they know this they know that 80% of the time the market is in balanced not imbalanced as in IM but in a balanced environment ie ranging so they're very calibrated towards those environments so when it goes imbalanced many market players they don't get involved now I'm not talking you know small imbalances obviously when you know you have say a few days of balance and then you have imbalance and then you have a few days of balance no they're very active in those environments I'm talking about we have you know multiple days weeks even of imbalance and huge profiles they're not active because they recognize that those periods aren't ideal conditions but my point isn't that my point is did you notice how I identified that so what this will allow you to do is it will develop your understanding of identifying market conditions and really that's why I wanted to say all of this because by the end of not necessarily the course but at least over the next 12 months you know but obviously this exercise is just really going to get you started doing that and that's the point of me getting you doing task one is and why we're doing this as I said I want you to really understand the purpose and how this helps you identify trading opportunities you need to become experts in knowing when the market is in retail terms ranging I call it balance or not ranging and you may call it trending whatever you want to call it expansion or whatever institutions will call it imbalance and we already said why that is is because what aggressive market orders right market orders on the buy side are greater than market orders on the sell side etc etc so look I'm not going to again I keep saying this but I've explained all of this in great detail about what balance and imbalance is point is we're now going to show you or I'm going to show you how to identify this market condition and really guys that is all I'm doing and ladies that's all I'm doing okay all I'm doing all day long in whatever market I'm trading be it S&P crude oil all I'm doing is I'm identifying is there balance or imbalance and what it is is you'll see it's not I wish it was as simple as that because there's different investors there will be people in the depth of market will obviously find particular areas that on a composite might be balanced but on a microscopic depth of market might be imbalanced so you know that is essentially where the I guess you could call it the holy grail lies but it's not an indicator it's obviously you're using a bit of your critical thinking and really that's where your edge and your alpha comes in you know where I've said it use your judgment but we'll talk a lot more that about that as we develop and introduce all these different lenses I've already showed you the depth of market I'm now going to show you composite right I needed to start you off on the depth of market so you could look at how is volume profile built up and it just happened to be that you got an added bonus of how algorithms view value on a very microscopic time frame we're now going to move on and look at a different lens essentially of static value okay but what we're going to now do is we're going to identify this and I know I've taken a while to go over this first bullet point but I cannot I really cannot sort of say this enough is that essentially you've got to be able to identify balance versus imbalance okay that is all you're ever doing because all the market is doing is balancing or imbalancing balancing or imbalancing balancing or imbalancing and I have had a few people ask me well hang on doesn't one investor see so you see here this could be balance imbalance balance imbalance for an algorithm and this could just be balanced right for a sort of bigger term perspective investor and people ask me that look don't worry about that I acknowledge that and I know that believe me and we will get into that and that's where things really do get quite difficult and complicated obviously I'll try and help you manage that but let's identify conditions first right and then we can worry about different lenses and putting it all together but that's the point is don't worry about all that stuff about this time frame that time frame this investor that investor that's all yet to come just worry about is the market balanced or imbalanced and that's it then we'll put obviously all the different perspectives together okay so again just to repeat the point the purpose and why we're even doing this and identifying trading opportunities is we'll identify balance or imbalance and what that will do is essentially I kind of hinted at it that you know in balanced environments I said institutions are obviously calibrated to play that environment and the reason they take their foot off the gas in in battle or long periods of imbalance is because you trade range or in or balanced environments differently so what you'll typically be doing obviously is you'll be fading right and you saw me do that you saw me do it on the depth of market the trading market I faded where I thought the market would remain imbalanced remember right at the top but if you can identify that the market is imbalanced what you're going to be doing you're not going to be fading the market are you fading as in opposing the market because you're going to get crushed the market is telling you something is seeking value higher or lower so let's go with it right you call it trend trading I don't I call it there's particular names I give it okay and we're going to get onto that what the exact names are but the market condition identification that I give it is imbalanced okay so I always know from any perspective again don't think about the other perspectives right now but just any perspective in particular whether the market is imbalanced i.e. range balance or imbalance do you see where it's seeking is seeking value higher and I've talked about this in ebay ebay's doing it all the time but obviously it's one direction the price will keep going up keep going up until it finds value right okay so we just need to identify are we here and then we we will identify trading opportunities once I introduce the VWAP I'll give you a framework for being able to identify how to actually take the trade so that's very close now and the same thing when we identify that the market is imbalanced okay then we will now be able to identify trading opportunities to go with the imbalance we're not going to be trading it the same way that we do balance so you know we need to identify the market condition once we've done that which is why I call it context it's one of the best traders in the world when and I don't want to bash retail and forgive me look at the end of the day you know believe me I don't get any pleasure out of bashing retail that's why I never mention one person in particular all it is is it just bothers me that um you're using all these things in all conditions right when do you ever say to yourself do you know what I've identified this market condition so I'm going to do things differently or I've identified people just don't do it it's so important you have to adapt and I'm going to teach you how to do that now by showing you that the market changes from balance to imbalance and the trading style that we use to take advantage of that is different so first we need to identify right um so secondly areas to conduct business context so what I mean by that right is exactly this so what have we just been talking about we said that the market is balanced and then goes once it gets out of balance gets imbalanced right and it seeks value and then suddenly we'll go balanced won't it now how many times have you seen that where you try to ride the trend and it just suddenly it goes flat okay now you know why that's happening because the market is found value it's no longer imbalanced okay so we need to identify that how do we actually identify that context contextual levels okay you've already seen it it's value areas basically value area high value area low okay so if we know that that is the value area low and that's the value area high ahead of time would you agree to start to book profits right if we go into this previous balance area which is what just a profile from before do you see why I call it static because it's static it's not changing it's already done it's historic when I get into this region am I going to start trying to play what you call again I don't as you know I keep saying it so that I don't call it trend okay I call it imbalance but I'm so I'm going to use those words now but is trend is what you're used to so let's just say it one final time am I going to be looking for trend trades in this area no can you see the power of identifying market condition because as soon as we get into balance areas previously we saw this in bread do you remember the bread price came down and then it got balanced after it had been imbalanced for a while the market's happy why are you trying to trade trend as we call it but or retail calls it why why do you see it's not what you want to do when you're in a prior area where the market has clearly told you with transactions that look I'm happy here as soon as you get in here stop that type of trading and switch to balance trading and this will become very clear you know like I said I'm going to have VWAP with the standard deviation bands and we're going to look for trading opportunities so that's also come very exciting stuff and I will get you very much taking opportunities in the style that I'm describing now balance and imbalance opportunities so but to do that we obviously do need some levels don't we well we can say you know so we've got profile here we've got a profile here and you know let's say the market's here we need a level don't we to say well if we start to build value here is that still balance or imbalance well we need a contextual level to identify when the market condition has changed well if we've got if we have this level which is the whole point of task one essentially you're identifying this level okay so and I'm going to show you how to do that composites joining up the profiles together and then you get these very nice value areas where you have obviously very nice um normal distributions with perfect not perfect but you know more ideal um characteristics that allow us to see balance again repeating a lot of what I've said in the past but you know obviously I like to do that so just to make sure that not 90% of people get it 100% of you get it and then yeah so like I said if we start to build value above I can say to myself in my prep oh you know what the market's imbalanced right now so let me look for imbalanced opportunities but to where I need to have areas do you see that I'm targeting it's not always going to go there but come on you always need a business plan don't you where's your target what do you expect to achieve when you run a business you're always looking for what am I likely to achieve in price this gives us the bottom end of a previous balance I expect imbalance to sort of get into ideally into this range but at least here I can start booking profits um and then if we get in here I'm done I'm no longer looking for imbalance and if I get some balance opportunities it's got a fading like we did on the depth of market where we look for absorption and then reversion whereas here we're not we're looking for absorption here on the south side to fail and aggression to come in going upwards boom and we got a nice contextual level up here can you see how it's starting to develop trading ideas because no longer are we just looking at nothing um we're actually looking at contextual level so that's the point of identifying and I know I spoke a lot about that but it was important that I explained why we're even doing this exercise um and task one is that is to identify areas for us to do business but more importantly identify the market condition so we know how to conduct business um so I just want to speak a little bit before I move on to the next slide about composites so I already talked about in part eight that we're combining um obviously balance areas together value but you know I cannot stress this enough there's no magic formula there are going to be times where it isn't obvious what you should do and the reason I point this out to you is because I know there's going to be and I've seen it time and time again I know there's going to be a lot of people who get obsessed with oh what's Envy doing is he you see so you might have value area here for one day and then you might have a value area here where it slightly overlaps do you merge them do you not merge them some people will say do you know what I think there was enough value here that balanced you see there this sort of little area here where they both balance some people will say yeah do you know what I think that was two days that from a value perspective were very close together so I'm going to join them together well someone else you might say no do you know what it wasn't and that's my point you've got to understand yeah there's no magic formula I'm going to talk about this a little bit become obvious as we go on that I would really be very careful how you approach this be loose with it and the reason I say this is because think about it right this really comes back to the reality check and the thing I said about alpha and I cannot stress this enough I'm gonna really try and stop myself talking about it too much here because I want to really talk about this more towards the end of the pro course but I did mention and I hinted you know alpha to generate alpha you've got to be doing things that are a little bit outside the box because otherwise think about it if it was obvious right where value was a hundred percent of the time I promise you someone out there with millions if not billions and there are institutions out there with that sort of money I know because I work there and I used to actually develop algorithms and you know I saw how much money these guys had if stuff like this was too obvious that doesn't mean that it's not useful for us to do it in fact it's great my point is if stuff like this was too obvious someone would program it and believe me the fact it isn't and you're going to see the fact it isn't always clear is an amazing thing because it allows you and I to do what develop edge using human characteristics i.e analytical capabilities that a machine can't use because we have to apply discretion and therefore I don't think people will quite grasp this until much further in their career what opportunity I am giving you to generate alpha okay now you might think to yourself you know what oh it's a cop-out Envy's not giving us something very like a plus b must equal c because if we don't get it then he has an opportunity to say oh it was you but you've got to start approaching this differently you know you've already tried that way doing all the retail methods where people tell you no you do this and do that and this should happen at the end of the day why do you think the failure rate is so high even in institutions because we are told the same things guys when I went and done my you know obviously I did have two trainings as you know in investment banking and then proprietary training I had there's so many people around me who got told exactly what I did why did they fail then they obviously got told the same things I did no it was because I recognized early in my career hang on I got to start to recognize things before the crowd does now I'm not saying that you know at the end of the day other people won't recognize what you're doing they will and you want them to it's just you want to recognize it earlier and therefore you have you just will never realize until much later as you develop into a very consistent trader because it's only going to happen when you start to and do things that the crowd aren't doing okay and you'll see this in my trading all the time is I'm always doing things that it's not that no one else is doing but they're not doing it when I'm doing it does that make sense that's alpha that is alpha right end of the day alpha is generating extra value above and beyond what beta which is what everyone's doing I'm giving you a golden opportunity and actually what you've got to realize and again I did say I didn't want to talk about this too much but I'm just going to say it and then I'll repeat in the reality check section is if I gave you right this perfect rule set and said guys when x happens and y happens merge the profiles together what you've got to realize is I'd actually be doing you a disservice because you're not going to succeed that way so why would I tell you something whereas as you know many other people are willing to give you rules and because that is what logically seems to make sense and it's what people want but that's why the failure is so high so let me give you the other side of the coin you're paying me to tell you how professionals succeed right so I don't want to lie to you how do professionals succeed and why do so few of them succeed they don't use these stupid rules that you hear about about oh when this happens you've got to merge it no you've got to snap out of that and start to use the guidelines I'm about to give you on the next page but with a pinch of salt and you start to think about whether it makes sense to you we can compare fine but stick to your guns and observe because at the end of the day what you'll find is sometimes you'll make better judgments than me and the market what it actually does will be more aligned to the decisions you took okay rather than what I did because and therefore you're going to generate alpha for yourself can you see why this concept of generating alpha and doing things um yourself as I said and proving them to yourself is so important but look that's not me abandoning you at all we're going to compare stuff and in fact what you'll notice is I'm going to put a section after this where I talk about how you'll notice it just after this because at the moment obviously I've got this discord room but I don't know how that's going to look in the future so I'm going to put it separately the section as to where we're all going to be doing this but I'm very much going to obviously have this area where we can all compare and help each other grow but it doesn't matter if it's different you know that's what you get paid to do so I think I've said enough on that but what it is is important because you're going to notice this as we go into the next section that this is really a brilliant opportunity to separate yourself from the crowd so that's enough said here let's go on I'm going to give you some guidelines about you know when you should be merging profiles together but again as I said here let's finish off on the final point which is that this thing about there being grey areas as you will notice when I give you the guidelines please take it as a positive a massive positive I'm giving you an opportunity to separate yourself from the 99.99999 percent that fail in this game and the very tiny amount that generate alpha you're never going to get given those tools in the retail environment as you know I'm giving you those tools to generate alpha and I can only help you so much like 90 95 percent the other five percent so embrace it embrace this opportunity to use your judgment okay and you know hopefully you take that on board and it's you know going to make you a much better trader for it so let's crack on and actually show you how can you generate this alpha and where do these sort of grey areas lie that you can spot things before many other people do even before algorithms do let's go and have a look okay so whilst you're doing this task which is you know obviously I want you to start creating composite profiles and develop contextual levels that you're going to be taking trades from and identifying market conditions you know whether the market's balanced or imbalanced etc there's just two or three administrative things that I want to talk to you about so you'll have to forgive me throughout this page it's a bit difficult what is I don't want to copy and paste parts of the chart and put it on here it's much better now because we're getting on the charts that so I've got my charts on the side I'm going to keep bringing my charts back and forth back and forth so there might be a little bit of back and forth going on so you'll have to forgive me but at the end of the day it's going to be much better for us to look at the actual charts rather than me just having cutouts here etc so number one is okay so this is very much now getting into the task phase task one which is the mergers I've mentioned this before letters or blocks okay so let's have a look here so I've got the S&P 500 here okay and I've got the same period here now I've written here letters or blocks guys honestly I don't care I really don't bother me I've had periods in my career where as I said I only looked at letters I never looked at blocks now I have for the last few years I've only looked at blocks because I gave you the reasons I don't particularly like getting too obsessed with the letters but I went on that journey and you know you're only going to generate alpha by going on the journey you know and I'm sorry to keep repeating the point but it's important I make it because I want you to know I'm actually giving you what you wanted right why have you come to me because you don't want a retail trading course you want to know how the professionals do it so if I tell you you have to use blocks then I'm just doing what any other retail educator is doing no and I'm not I'm not telling you the truth and the truth is when you're in an institution environment they're gonna tell you that you can do whatever you want figure it out work it out as in generate some alpha see what works for you there's no right or wrong answer some people can visualize see for me I find it easier just to look at this and say balance is there balance is there actually I'm not going to merge those two whereas some people find it easier on here to say do you know what balance is here and I'm sorry let me just scroll forward can you see those value area lines they're not there but they are now so sorry let me do that again so some people might find it easier on here to say you know what that's balance and there's some overlapping balance but not enough so I'm not going to merge them okay whatever whatever works for you try both we'll do some exercises with both but I just wanted to mention that here because this is what I gave the long speech I did on the previous slide I know some of you thought what is Envy going to get on with this but I cannot tell you I wish you know what I it would have saved me a lot of money and a lot of time as in you know as I said I never really had a period where I lost money but lost money in the sense that it held me back from really hitting the exponential curve a lot earlier in my career because I became too obsessed about oh that guy on the prop trading floor is doing this I'll have to do what he does no do you know what I dropped that stuff and I just did what worked for me and I want you to understand that becoming a professional trader is all about developing this independence and entrepreneurial flair which many of you have already looked no don't think I'm taking that away from you I know many of you run your own businesses or some of you work in incredibly um you know professional environments that require you to have entrepreneurial flair it's just that a lot of people don't apply that skill that is within them to trading apply it here start to think outside of the box think about it when you start a business is there really a handbook as to oh yeah here you go this is how you become no don't exist could have there's obviously people like me who can help you but ultimately there's so many things you've got to figure out yourself and you know that's why I'm going to keep laboring the point and I said it in the previous slide is um because I know what's going to happen and it's going to keep happening people are going to say no Envy's using blocks so I'm going to use blocks because he's using box blocks and that's the right way no right or wrong way in this obviously look guys don't get me wrong and I hope this puts you at ease is that if you combine say this value area with that value area clearly I'm going to say to you look stop you haven't quite got it let's go back and try and sort of develop your understanding again however if you're doing this and you're combining it with this and there's some overlap and we're not sure and it's a bit do it see how it works observe it a and b coming back to the original point if you're using letters and I'm using blocks I don't care it doesn't matter okay so don't just use blocks because I'm using blocks go on the journey try both see what works for you fiddle around with both play around with them you know I want to see where we're all doing this whether it be in discord or whatever um platform that I'm using at the time I said you know I'm going to talk about that in a separate section just in case I change it in the future whatever platform um or sort of congregational area that we're using to discuss this I want to see both I want to see people using blocks I want to see people using letters whatever suits you okay um so that mindset you've got to have that all the time that where there's these grey areas and there's no right or wrong you do what works for you and prove it to yourself and see what you find easier visually you know for me it's obviously blocks for you it may be letters okay so I think I've pretty much exhausted that point and you get it but it was important I said it because I don't want people going away thinking oh my god I can't use this because Envy isn't using this no that's not the point um and then number point number two is administrative again is look the tick settings and rth settings I've talked about rth to death the tick settings I haven't and I'm not going to go into detail because it's it's a very personal thing the tick settings if you go and um and I appreciate you may not have watched the footprint section yet but um when you watch the footprint section this will make a lot of sense because with the footprint with the rankos and again if this doesn't make sense you don't worry but it will when you watch the footprint section is I talk about calibrating you know sometimes I use five tick ranges six ticks four ticks it can vary and it is a very much a judgment call you need to make however I'm going to show you that there's some settings okay within and I'm not you look at the end of the day this never changes for me I always leave it at what I do so I use three tick settings for crudo and I use two ticks for es you can use what you want it's not going to make a massive difference in the way that volume charts and rankos and those things do change seasonally quite a lot because you're looking very much at um individual bars it can have a big impact but because profile periods are so big 30 minutes and so on and so forth and there's only so many periods through the day as you can see let's have a look at for example the es which we just had right you can see there's very few periods whether I use and I'll explain what that means whether I use different tick settings it's not going to make a difference so you know play around with them by all means if you want or you can use the ones I do I recommend you use the ones I do but just make sure that they're correct when you're in the software so let's talk about that because um I understand that's not going to make sense to you unless I show it to you so let's do rth settings first so if I go to um so for this I'll press f6 okay um and it brings up in fact we're doing the rth settings so apologies 8 f5 which brings up this um chart settings what you need to worry about is start time and end time okay just make sure they're correct now what it is is okay with the e-mini s&p do you remember I said the rth is 9 30 to 4 15 eastern time now I have um sierra set as us time so it's all calibrated to eastern um now if your sierra chart is calibrated to uk time or different time zone you can change it but even though I'm in the uk I like to have us time frame or zones on mine so you know you just have to accept that's what I'm doing and adjust accordingly if that's not comfortable for you but that's what I like to do but that's a but b more importantly make sure you remember I said we're only looking at rth profiles I'll set it for this for you when I obviously give you the template but in the future sometimes you might fiddle around with things and I like to check this just make sure double check have I got the right time frame and time zones in sorry time zone in here now what you may have noticed is I have noticed some people put 9 30 to 4 15 in here or you know one second before 4 15 um now the reason I do it up to 4 30 is because what happens otherwise is you see the final period so let's just split one of these out this final period the end period what will happen is if you think about it if I only use 4 15 it's only going to be a 15 minute period it's not a big deal I know some people who are obsessive like I said and they're like no the session ends up 4 15 so I'm gonna um use that as 4 15 and I've done it in the past but as I said as I became more loose with things this was something I developed over time where I just started thinking do you know what I don't care what a book told me I don't care what this guy told me I care what observation told me and what my own logic tells me logically do I prefer to see a full 30 minute tpo period when all my other periods are 30 minutes to me it's like yeah do you know what I'm gonna do what I want to do I don't care if my boss uses 4 15 I don't care if the other guys know what works for me logically what makes sense made more sense to me and then it wasn't that I thought has my pnl changed because I decided not no does it make any difference to me no actually I'm getting a better reflect reflection of that last periods full of 30 minute tpo um you know period so I use 4 30 okay I don't want my end period to just be 50 as in 15 minutes because think about it it's every half an hour isn't it from 9 30 so it'll be 9 30 to 10 10 to 10 30 etc etc etc until you get to 4 o'clock then the last period if you only put 4 15 it's just going to be a 15 minute period it's going to cut it off and actually if you think about it eth goes on till what um five o'clock isn't it so you've still got another 45 minutes before the maintenance period starts so um it's a personal point I just prefer to leave that as 4 30 so it's up to you again like I said don't do what I do test it do 4 15 does it make a difference for a month then do 4 30 does it make a difference do you see this is why I've always said to people this journey as a trader don't let anyone tell you it's quick it's not if you're gonna have to figure this stuff out it might take you a month or two to even work out these little little settings you know do I want blocks do I want letters do I want 4 15 do I want 4 30 do I want this is going to confuse you do I want the overnight profile here I don't necessarily put it here but I have in the past that that overnight and RTH split out so I could see that we rebalanced when we came into the open session I'm going a little bit way too advanced here but my point is these things take time to figure out guys you've got to be patient and um I haven't put it here but I will talk about it towards the end and this is another thing and it is important I mention this is how long do I want you to spend doing tasks well you know I hate putting timelines to it it's an ideal timeline is you know for this is going to be like a couple of weeks spent doing merges I don't care if it takes you three months spend three months it's going to make you a better trader these small small things figuring them out the advantage is when you do all this you can do it at the weekends do it anytime right they're all static profiles it's great it's an exercise you can do any time of day after work you come in the evening after dinner weekends doesn't matter just keep doing it um but anyway so those are the settings for um ES now give me a second because I just got to go and find crude oil okay sorry it took me a moment I just have to find crude oil because things are a little bit all over the place there um so again this time I'm going to go chart settings which is f5 can you see my time zone well time sorry my time period rth so it's right up until one second before obviously because the bell is basically at three o'clock so I just uh sorry 230 so the rth I end it so just make sure the rth hours because what will happen is if you don't set this obviously it's going to give you profiles for longer than rth and we've already been through this to death in the last part why you don't want that okay so that's essentially the rth settings dealt with just make sure that in the template I give you I've actually built the template because I want to put vwap in there and we're going to do vwap before I give you the template um so I haven't done that yet but um yeah when I do it will be obvious anyway and then just go in there and do the settings so with this tick setting so we've dealt with the rth let's um deal with sorry just give me a second let's deal with the tick settings now so I'm not going to change the tick settings because I'm just going to tell you what I use and what it means okay so let's start with the e-mini s&p first okay so there's this thing where is it uh okay this is quite a lot of stuff written on the top there so it's not um you won't be able to see it's not visible but I'll show you so I press f6 right to bring up the chart studies where my tpo is and then I go into settings now there's this thing letter block price increment in ticks and I've got two okay so think about it what it's saying here letter block do you want to say you can have letters or blocks it doesn't matter let's say it's letters the price increment in ticks is two okay and you'll also see it here when you go into chart settings can you see 0.5 that's two ticks in the e-mini s&p 0.25 is one tick 0.5 is two ticks by 30 minute periods all it's saying is each one of these letters changes every two ticks do you see I could have it as one tick and you'll get loads of these it won't change the obviously high to low because the high to low will be the high to low but all it's going to do is rather than printing an e every two ticks it will print an e every one tick okay it's just more granular if I do three ticks then it will do every three ticks so I kind of found two to be a nice happy medium for me you can play around with it or you can just use what I use I'm not too fussed I would normally as you know I say look do what suits you but personally I think two is pretty much okay I haven't changed it I don't think except when I fiddled with it right at the start of my career I think it's been I can't even remember ever changing this setting it's been even through all the virus period and all the you know shocks that have hit the economy throughout the last few years I've never changed the setting so you know I like to whatever you choose stick with it I would suggest just use the same as I do but yeah it's up to you and then in crude oil I'm slightly different and the reason for that is and I tell you it's very obvious actually sorry just give me one second I'll just minimise crude oil I need to go and find it again just one sec okay so there's crude oil sorry it's because I don't have my template I'm building this template for you guys so I'm not it's a little bit messy that's why I've had to go and look for it otherwise normally if it was my own template which I use obviously every day then it would just be up but anyway we've got it so that's the point exactly the same thing we go to f6 and there you can see I've got three ticks so the way you change that is you go to settings and you can see letter block price increment so this time I want it to show me this a period you see how I've got 37 38 39 40 and then it will jump okay the reason I've got it a slightly higher if you think about it crude oil it's more volatile isn't it it moves more than the S&P so I don't because the thing is if I set it at the same level as the S&P I'll have all these tiny a's everywhere it'd be too much so I found what is a nice balance for me in terms of not having too many a's that what you've got to remember is it doesn't it doesn't really change much in the sense that the high and the low of the a period is going to be the same okay the high and the low all it is is the number of a's it shows you okay so you don't want too many and you don't want too little because then it's going to be meaningless and you don't want too many because then it'll be meaningless as well it's a nice balance and I found for me that there you can see it here three ticks works really nicely in crude oil again I don't think I've ever changed that I'm talking years that I've been using market profile I don't think I've ever changed it you know however many years it's been since I've been obviously I started looking at it maybe eight ten years ago never changed it okay so you can if you want but look as you know I want this to be the best education in the market and the most reflective of a professional environment that's why I tell you these things it's easy for me just to give you market profile and just not even talk about this and you'd be none the wiser so I hope you can appreciate why I really spend time and effort explaining every little thing to you so you understand you understand everything right and your knowledge becomes best in market you need to know all this stuff you know no point me not telling you just so I can make this a lot quicker than ideal but no that's not it the best way to do it sorry so that's why I tell you all of this stuff but look those are my settings you can do what you want really there's no right or wrong answer do what works for you but in those instances where it comes to obviously RTH using RTH I would highly suggest you do use the RTH hours because that's what obviously everyone's doing and obviously I explained in part a why it can get a bit messy and then the tick settings I'd suggest you use the ones I do because it gives you a nice balance but try them out see for yourself and then if you want to revert back to what I do then I think that's a good idea and then this bit using basic basic RTH chart to guide you I'm going to come back to that because what I'll show you is how I don't do it anymore but I think it's quite nice it's something that I was doing early in my career where I started merging profiles is I used to use the chart sometimes scrunched up to help me identify whether it sort of makes sense for me to merge profiles together so do you know what let me I put this up here I don't know why I put it up here but as in why I didn't put it down here but let's come back to that okay but I'll just leave that there as a reminder but I will come back to that and basically that's it for the admin albeit I'll come back to that let's get on with the guidelines all right so let's what I want to do in this final bit before I get you actually doing merges for yourself and doing task one is I'm going to do some guidelines here where I'll show you what sort of guidelines I use again use your discretion generate alpha and in fact I've even said it here haven't I I think I say a couple times because I said this to death in the last page I'm not going to repeat what I was saying but you can see why I said it so much in the last page because it's a great opportunity for you to do that but let me show you why that opportunity exists and to give you some guidelines as well to help you really develop or hone your skill set in at least making what I think is a good decision not necessarily always the right or wrong decision but a good decision that's going to give you a higher probability of having good contextual levels to do business from so let's start with the first one so what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to keep bringing the chart back and forward as I show you this rather than just showing you cutouts here so let's do the first one okay so to save time what I'm going to do is you will see me editing this a little bit where I just bring the chart I show you then I take the chart off but I'll edit me obviously going and bringing charts back and forward just to obviously cut down the time so let's do the first one what do I mean by guideline number one if the overlapping value is clear we merge them let's look at an example okay so I've brought over here crude oil guys you're going to see this quite a lot but unfortunately it's not always the case but you know maybe uh 30 40 50 percent of the time that you go to merge you will get really nice um balances that you can merge okay so when I say overlapping value okay so what you've got to remember is and the good thing is I did the auction market theory section and obviously I talked to you a lot about thinking of the market in terms of value remember what is our objective here we're merging value okay value and value and you know what um it's up to you how you do this I'm going to be quite honest with you yes it's nice to have these value area lines and we can say that is so you've got two ways of thinking of this you can either say to yourself um that this is strictly speaking value is is this area which is the 70 percent and this area which is the 70 percent see the thing is you've got to understand and this is why I did the probability section what you're going to find is these are not 100 accurate why is that do you remember I talked about in the probability distribution section where is can you see that there's no volume here there's no prominent like clear area where you've got this mode this value you see here this is actually quite nice when you see quite a nice prominent area where transactions took place think of the ebay example or a million other examples I've given you the more volume you can get in a particular area the more people found that to be a fair price value but what you'll find is that a lot of distributions on the day they're going to not make sense from a balanced perspective in terms of a statistical distribution and therefore the value area lines are not going to be like 100 perfect right we talked a lot about this in the previous section so it's up to you how you do this you can either do it mechanically but I've talked about the trap of doing that but you can start like that if you want you can do it the way I do I'll tell you honestly I don't really pay much attention to these value area lines until I merge them and you'll see why that is what I like to do is and you know what believe it or not I used to actually mark these with this um funny enough that's how I heard about this it's called epic pen but you can whatever you want you can use a little tool I don't do this anymore but I used to do this a lot and what I used to do is I used to mark them with this pen like this balance balance okay and I would just kind of say well do you know what there's balance here and there's balance kind of here so it's close enough but you see in this this balance area my sort of visual balance is slightly wider and that's because you've got to remember on an individual day you're going to get imperfect areas where the market didn't feel in a smooth pattern and therefore the value areas might be slightly up but coming back to this can you see perfect balance on Wednesday and Thursday that's about as clear as you're going to get where there's an overlap in value okay guys we're not talking about high to low don't forget we're talking about where value took place because okay there might have been an extreme move down here but essentially the market did that didn't it and we're looking for what the general that's a terrible uh sorry I apologize that's actually pretty terrible do that again market did what kind of did that there okay and what we're saying is the bulk of it took place in that region okay so um and in fact what I'll do is here I'll show you the basic RTHR show you why that used to be quite useful for me but in this instance I hope it's obvious but basically we have balance here balance here so I'm going to merge them so how do you merge so what you do is right you click on you right click okay on the profile merge with next profile on this profile can you see or this one merge with prior profile it's up to you so in this instance I'm going to do merge with next profile guys look can you see now why I now pay much more attention to the value area line why look at how smooth that is it's beautiful can you see what difference it makes why is that because now we've had more data the market's had opportunity to do what let me just undo this again you've got to understand this not as a mathematician but just very much from a common sense logical perspective about what's balance it's even what was the normal distribution it's even don't worry about the mathematics just worry about what we're trying to measure here balance so obviously we want a nice symmetrical um balanced shape okay and yeah to some extent you've got to take my word for it that these value areas have perfect not perfect but very very strong statistical properties that give us very nice standardized value areas but the more symmetrical this is the better and would you not agree and it kind of makes sense that let me just unmerge these on merge so to unmerge you just do undo all merges in this profile okay a lot of this stuff you can play around with and you'll figure it out but obviously i'll try and tell you as much as i i can um sorry undo all merges in this profile yep so i took it out can you see it fills in some of these problem areas that i had it gave the market what opportunity guys it's unbelievable how the market does this when there's typically areas like this the market will come very early on and it will fill them out you know why that is don't you it's because the market is really wants to develop value and fill in and test the market to really see that there was true value there so the market does that because it wants to see does value stick in that area before we move on and seek value elsewhere really complete that auction process right auction market theory auction process that goes on there so you see this a lot the market does it a lot essentially it loves to fill in areas but this is one of the reasons here you're seeing why i've merged them because as soon as i merge it look at that it's beautiful i get a really prominent area from my point of control as well which is really important um instead of what and i know i'm going on and on about this but believe me this this stuff is uh it's magical really not in a holy grail way but in the terms of identifying where the market is um really um like equating value to be very very very powerful in terms of statistical properties so back to the point i was talking about which is the point of control can you see here theory i see too many people do this they'll say nope that's the point of control hang on a minute what about that in my mind there was decent amount of volume taking place there and there was decent amount of volume taking place there why can't you say that's the point of control very advanced i noticed this through years of observation i've learnt that just because the software or some guy sitting there who's written a book says no that's got to be the volume or um poc for market profile obviously volume point of control for vpoc no sorry i'm going to do what makes logical sense to me and if i see a lot of volume here and i see a lot of volume here it's very even but look what happens when i combine it with the next day merge with next profile boom can't be argued really nice prominent area like in terms of the point of control but also more importantly than that it gives us what contextual levels this is what you're building now is trading levels okay do you think it's any coincidence that we broke out of balance right look what actually happened here and i promise you you will see this time and time again but this is honestly this is literally i just randomly picked a day last october i've obviously i traded this probably but many months ago i don't remember what this looked like this is just random example and i'm going to show you loads of this stuff that how magical is not the right word because it sounds like some sort of holy grail but it isn't it's truth basically about what the market is doing and what it's trying to achieve do you remember what i said to you once we identify contextual levels i'm sorry i know i said i'm just going to give you guidelines but look i like to talk about these things so you actually know what's going on and it's not just some rule that i say i merge it crack on no i want to show you what's actually going on and why we're merging and what what is telling us right do you remember what i said to you that the market is in balance in this area and we can then identify if we're in this region we'll fade we'll look for absorption and aggression to come in the same way we did on the market no difference or when we go out and we build value value imbalance now what actually happened here think about it market opened here what did it do you drove down tested value failed built value long opportunities here to buy the market okay in balance can you see why these levels are absolutely crucial as part of your you know that um pyramid the 70 percent context that's why i've got you doing this as stage one because this is going to be the core part of your prep that i want you to start doing once i've showed you vwap and everything we're going to get you doing prep and stuff hypothesis for the day you're going to be using these levels essentially what you're going to do is you're going to come in in the morning right i've been doing this for years guys like this is this is what i do if you're going to trade the way professionals do the way i do obviously not every professional but at least the way i do and how i see the top professionals doing it is you're going to come in in the morning you're going to see where the overnight traded let's say it's like this and your prep is going to say do you know what from a composite perspective where are we imbalanced okay we're not in balance we're not in a range market and look what the market did it went overnight and then it opened up we drove down and then what you can look at all the flow here and see does it reject or does it come in and accept okay and then it didn't it rejected didn't it and then it went up boom let me look for trading opportunities to imbalance or as you call it trend bar obviously i don't like to call it that but ultimately it's the same principle but then look what happened the next day right there was no merge we broke here remember what i told you are you going to be looking for imbalance opportunities when you're in previous balance no you're not of course not it's ludicrous these have now become contextual levels for you we're going to do this after this anyway i'm going to show you but look we've opened here you see it's very dangerous to be looking for these type of trades what you want to be doing is look fading fading we got some rejection here we came back in bounced what faded here and then we ended the day here okay you see very clear the market balanced in side of you see what did it do just balanced inside of a previous value and strong value composite value right wednesday and thursday merged together this is the power of merging profiles so we've covered the overlapping value but actually what i want to do is this was crude oil let me show you just one other merges here let me show you the e-mini s&p and i'll show you a very clear example because why not show you a couple markets isn't it rather than just one notice how i'm showing you letters here blocks letters doesn't matter this was my point earlier i'm just doing this because i know some of you will like to use the letters at first it is actually quite nice to start off with letters and then progress but in the future you'll see me very much doing this on blocks but i want to do both just so i can cover of both and show to people it doesn't really make that much difference right can you see here balance balance easy decision overlapping value merge perfect let's merge them remember how we do it right click merge with next profile boom there you go okay so you've got your um now you've got trading levels okay you've got that area you've got that area okay you've seen me mark these levels all the time on my charts okay there you go look market opened left value we've got a huge opportunity to trade short and then rejection at previous value and then we came back out and did what we just balanced here we just balanced and then look when we came back in boom we shot up to the other side the value okay and then we broke out and then we went up we broke out and then we went up and i'll show you how to identify um sort of trading opportunities within here but look you can see and then we broke up the next day we came back in but there was no value being built here so no trading opportunities and then we broke out and then potentially what trading opportunities to go short to go short because we were imbalanced okay then we got rejection same as we did here and where did we go back it's a previous value okay i'm going to show you again look how to identify um you know opportunities to look for rejection you see the excess here and these are all little little obviously more specific um trading framework using volume uh weighted average price VWAP that a lot of institutions are all using and i'm going to show you how to do that but the point is first we need to be able to identify contextual levels where we can actually say what is the market balanced or imbalanced so here it's very much out of balance isn't it here it's very much out of balance whereas obviously um although it's not merged there is a good example of balance here we just undo all mergers in this profile sorry just bear with me okay so you can see it here essentially this day this day was very much within the profile of the previous day so it was very much balancing the reason i've shown you this example is because i wouldn't i don't have any obviously clear examples right now because i've only got four profiles here of what i showed you in crude oil which was the balance within a previous balance area but um let me see actually if i can find one like i said i don't ever undo all merges for this sorry uh that's it um i don't actually ever pick any of these in advance so let's see if i can just find one here for you um where we had some sort of balance clear balance and then we balance the following day within that area okay so we those those that and that i would merge them okay and that i would merge them some people wouldn't but i'll come back to that but i just want to show you that within a balanced day see again that is not that's clearly imbalanced where you've got balance so that doesn't work uh in fact what i'm going to do i hope you don't mind is i'm going to feel difficult he is because i didn't have it expanded i was looking at it from such a small perspective there you go so i hope you can actually see the benefit of me doing this is they're not cherry picked i'm actually showing you you know a few months ago i don't even have a clue what this looked like like so these aren't pre-picked examples i want to show you this works all the time so did you see what i did there basically so i found what i was looking for an example of balance within previous balance as opposed to where you see imbalance right so this was uh so let me just undo those two do you remember i said i would personally merge these where you merge them here okay and you've got your contextual levels to trade from can you see what the next day actually did it went imbalanced right it broke out and it tried to seek initially value elsewhere and then it came back and then it settled it the point is it went imbalanced it wasn't within this balance okay but look at this so i'm just showing you balance versus imbalance that's why i wanted to do that would you agree this is a nice example of where balance and balance is so you're gonna merge these two days right gonna merge them together obvious one very very clear merge next profile okay so what do we now have we have contextual levels to trade from okay there and there do you see this was what i was trying to find the next day is what in balance so i'm very much going to be looking for trading opportunities of either side where i get rejection okay so that's the difference you've got imbalance and you've got balance here see that what the market did guys i can tell you every algorithm in the world is trying to find this market condition balance imbalance and it will trade it accordingly when there's when we're in a balance situation are you rotational like this and then we come in the next day and we're within where the market has been in value every algorithm in the world is going to be looking for absorption in these areas to then go to the other side and test what's going to look for absorption in these areas and look for the other side and test until we break out and then we start to form value and you'll see everyone bailing and then it will go imbalanced okay and essentially that's the opposite of what happened on an imbalance day where we essentially broke out so can you see it here we broke outside of value we came out we got some balance everyone in the world knows okay we're building value outside of the value area alone we're outside of previous rotation balance all that imbalance so all algorithms will be selling very early on in this environment and then obviously people took profits exhaustion or whatever and then everyone starts bailing so you see the reversion coming back in these are things obviously you need to identify dynamically throughout the day and you know that's where you build alpha and that's why being a trader is much more than just oh this indicator gave me some rule so i'm going to do that no absolutely garbage got to start to think outside the box and think oh you know as the day goes on oh the markets got very short here because we were imbalanced what happened we had excess in this period so and then we're building value here we're failing to go down anymore the people that got long into sorry short into this they're going to bail boom do you see this is all dynamic you're going to develop this understanding over many many months and obviously as you develop your career you're going to develop this type of understanding where you're kind of getting that read obviously there's a lot of things going on here and i don't want to confuse you too much but it all starts somewhere doesn't it with identifying areas for us to do business in and identify conditions and that's what my point was why i tried very hard even though it may have seemed like i couldn't find what i was looking for it's because i don't pre-plan any of this all the examples i show you and will be showing you is i like to do it not pre-planned because then i can very much show you that this is happening everywhere and not just me cherry picking something or whatever where i think it may have happened before no that's that's not the case at all so i just wanted to show you why obviously here we're looking at them because it helps us to identify the next day are we in the rotational environment or are we out of the rotational environment okay so let's go back to the next point so what's the next point next point is where it's unclear okay um and i'll be honest with you there are going to be situations where you and i do things differently so give me a second let me just go and pull up either crude oil or the e-minis and we'll find um and there's loads of them it's very easy for me to pull these out is where there's some um areas where it's not very clear so um just thinking what to do first shall i show you the example or shall i just go through these guidelines very quickly about what i'm going to do in the example so let me tell you this actually if it's unclear you've got to ask yourself what is the market trying to achieve what is it actually trying to do and you've got to start thinking in terms of value okay so just remember these points um and then we'll come back to this so just give me a second let me go and find because again i've minimized it i'm gonna have to go and find it okay so i managed to bring this back up and actually um i haven't actually gone through this section as you know but um hopefully we'll be able to find some really good examples of where it's great and in fact it's easy to find examples of where it's not clear cut because markets aren't clear cut so there's plenty of examples of both but um what i'll do is i will do that but i just realized one thing and that is that um so where it's great and you'll see what i mean by various where it's not clear where we don't have this clear overlap in terms of two value areas for two days three days whatever um we do need to ask ourselves what is it trying to do what is it trying to achieve and i'm going to show you how to do that um but there's another thing absolutely crucial if it's still unclear merge them anyway and see how balanced it looks okay so let's do that and to do that um what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to maximize this um so let me just get rid of all this ink so like i said i'm just i haven't looked at this in donkey so i don't actually know if um there's going to be great examples but yeah it's easy you can see there's loads of them here actually what's probably easier is if i just go through a whole sort of section let's do that actually because otherwise you're going to be wondering am i looking for something and i'm not actually i'm trying to look for like really good examples where i can make my point but it doesn't matter let's just go through them together and in fact i'm sorry to keep jumping this is just literally how guys sorry i'm a trader i'm not a presenter so you know you'll have to forgive my presentation skills not being so polished as you might be used to but i think it's better because i can actually show you how i'm thinking throughout the day here and actually what i've realized is let's just cover all of the bases off because what i'm going to do is i'm going to go through rather than me trying to find ones that match these bullet let's just cover them all off as i merge throughout the day so where i've said here some days may not be value but when new days form will be value what i mean there is because i just noticed it here is can you see here this day and this day i'm not going to merge them because what value was clearly here and value was down here then look at the next day i'm going to merge these three because what's actually happened what has the market actually done it's open here hasn't it it's gone up you see it's actually not gone anywhere that is balance okay but when you look at it as two individual days it's not balance when you've got that and that it's the third do you see and that's what i mean by saying where two days may not be value where you merge but then when a new day forms you get balance because that third day kind of doesn't take you anywhere you don't get value moving anywhere so you know it's important to remember that essentially so let's just remind ourselves again of this so this is what we're going to do and i know it seems like i'm a little bit all over the place at the moment but it's not because what it is is i'm trying to make sure that i cover all these items off without me jumping here jumping there jumping everywhere let's just try and cover them off as the market moves day by day so you can see you're gonna have to make these decisions every day so number one is what's it trying to achieve number two is merge them anyway if it's not clear so these are these are all where it's unclear what is it trying to achieve merge them anyway and then remember sometimes it may not be valued but then when it is obviously you get the extra third day it becomes value so i just what it is i just wanted you to remember all those three points because i'm not going to have them in front of us when we actually go through this so let's now try to look for examples where all those three points come into the four so actually what i'm going to do is i'm going to start here right and i'm going to work my way and i'm going to show you what i would do from this day all the way let's do like quite a few days now together and i want you to do this as task one okay so on this day tuesday the 15th value was there balance values here not going to merge them no okay so i'm going to merge those two but then what happened we came in here so we didn't go anywhere for three days did we what did we do we actually balanced in this area and do you remember what i said if you're still unsure merge them anyway see what they look like so let's do that okay so remember i'm not going to go i'm actually going to go through all of these with you together now merge with next merge with next okay so to me i like this i know there's a trunk missing here but that's okay i still think it's pretty good balance for me that's a decent area where the market's done nothing can you see why this is a great opportunity to generate alpha because honestly you might decide that do you know what i'm gonna wait for this volume do you remember how i said to you the market does fill volume in and it will fill it and it does fill it in the next day you might wait for that to get filled in and say actually i don't necessarily want that to be a contextual level so it's up to you guys at the end of the day whether you merge it or not that's where it's a little bit unclear and you have these gray areas it's up to you but if you were to ask me i'd be okay with either decision you made in this instance okay so let's um undo merges you can leave it as it is and what the other thing is when there's no and i will explain this a little bit later but when there's no sort of merging happening and there's no previous contextual levels you can just trade off the prior value so you can see the market's clearly doing that so you know if you decided not to merge any of these you could basically you know get short below here look for imbalance and then the next day we have value area high here you can look for imbalance which is what the market does then you come into the next day and you can look for imbalance downwards just you know what i mean this is where you can actually start to add value as a trader or build alpha because you know you may have decided not to merge these and here your decision paid off and you generated alpha for yourself whereas like i said i probably would have merged these three and you see my value area would have ended up being slight my contextual level wasn't as good as yours it was down here so i would have had to wait basically for some build to happen here and then go down down and actually what it is is it's the difficulty about teaching someone how to trade is that this is just one lens more than likely i would have seen stuff in here that would have clued me in that we're going to attack this and maybe go down to some sort of previous value but at the end of the day that's way beyond the scope of task one you're just going to get confused right now all i want you to do is get used to finding areas where balance overlaps over multiple days so these value areas become accurate to the point that you can use them to trade off okay so we need loads of examples so don't worry you know if it looks like oh i'm lost or i don't know i need to see more of this to make sure i know what i'm doing don't worry we're going to do loads that's why i'm actually going to go through the whole period um and show you that it is very subjective at times not always i've shown you where value is very clear so anyway i said that i would merge this i would merge that can you see clearly you're going to merge this right i'm going to anyway because i see value here and i see value here to me you're pretty much the bulk of value is inside the previous value and clearly the market was just filling in this area you know and again what did i say you can test if you're not sure um you can test the a and you can see what was the market trying to achieve so what do i mean by that split it out so look split profile sorry not split profile where we are uh letters blocked in their own column just split it out it's obvious to me what was the market trying to achieve opened up went rotational for a bit tried in balance did it succeed no i think it failed came straight back into balance so i'm going to merge them because to me the market failed going imbalanced and came back in to my rotational environment a so it's past that litmus test that i gave it and then b when i merge them does it give me a nice uniform sort of a symmetrical distribution let's have a look merge with next profile yeah it does it's pretty solid to be honest it's not ideal obviously you'd want that to be filled out guys but you've got to understand trading isn't perfect and actually it's very very nice contextual levels 100 i would be merging those you can see it there very very nice area of balance and then we can use these levels to trade from and identify that that is a rotational environment okay um let's get rid of that okay so we've done that we've merged that would you then see like i said i don't want to cherry pick so i'm just going to keep going let's see what would i do you know i'm literally being put on the spot here um so i can show you in a trading real trading environment what would i typically be doing and obviously in the discord and stuff like that i'll show you my merges we can compare them but my point is i want you to see that they can be a bit subjective and i like that i embrace that because i know do you know what maybe i'll be able to spot something that the algos can you see my whole point here is and i really want you to see that i don't want you to look at this and think oh my god i'm never going to get this is so confusing it's not clear to me when i merge them or not i want you to flip traditional status quo thinking on his head and realize this is where you will really become a trader because do you remember i talked about um you might think this is off topic but it isn't remember i talked about algorithms and i said algorithms are very powerful in the depth of market and we don't have edge there because obviously they're they're spotting absorption they're spotting aggression they're spotting spoofing in milliseconds and it's quite obvious it's happening if you have the eye for it and algorithms obviously are developed to see that because of the speed it's happening at because it's happening over days right algorithm haven't got an edge over us in this a and b can you see because of this subjective it's not let's be fair right it's not like completely subjective and you line up 10 people and they're going to give you different no it's not that let's be honest it's pretty obvious that you know that is a decent balance area all i'm saying is there is a little bit of gray which allows us this opportunity to have an advantage over an algorithm because an algorithm won't be able to do this an algorithm wouldn't be able to sit there and think and say hang on what does it look like when i balance all of them what's the market trying to achieve uh sorry about that my data because it's quite late right now it's friday night i'm actually doing this it's uh it's just settling to the market's about um um doing some settling motions or whatever it's actually the maintenance period so that's why i just did that sorry um i got a bit distracted by that but um so where was i so yeah the algorithm is not um able to do this type of stuff let me split it out and we haven't even got to the splits yet where you can actually start to split some of these out you know like i said if um something doesn't take your fancy you can split it out obviously in this particular example i wouldn't for now i don't want you to do the splits let's just um um keep it um sorry give me a second let's just keep it as merges and unmerges we'll go we'll come to the splits a little bit later for now let's just say would we merge it or not merge it merge with it and then do you remember i said i would merge these two days okay so we're back where we started right so like i said algorithms obviously can't do this stuff right they can't um just remove right most merging profile there you go so i took that out do you remember what i was saying what's the market trying to achieve well it went rotational it went in balance here came back and basically ended there it wasn't able within sort of the balance here to achieve any imbalance here to achieve any imbalance in my opinion do you see how do you program that into an algo you can't huge edge as a human being this is my point you know embrace this this is when i saw this i realized i've got an opportunity here to actually do what gain edge okay think about it if you work for a company and you want to get promoted can you do what everyone else is doing no of course not go do it differently you've got to look for opportunities where you might be able to get an edge you might be able to see things slightly differently to other people i'm not saying the market isn't going to do this anyway it is but what are we trying to do we're trying to spot what the market might be trying to achieve before anyone else and that's what my point is you see if i'm able to spot this before the next rth session begins when i do my hypothesis i can get in before most other people do and then i can make money off the back of when everyone else starts to see it that's all we're trying to do and this enables us to gain that little edge this is what edge really is okay you've heard a lot about this edge this is what edge really is and honestly i wish someone had sat me down and told me this and told me this is the secret sauce it's no you know some magical indicator combined with this combined with that now you'll be wasting your life looking for all that stuff this is start to become good at identifying balance and imbalance those two conditions i told you about so um apologies i did go slightly wasn't really off track but what it is is a lot of times when i'm doing a lot of this stuff i realize it's a golden opportunity for me to share these things with you and that's why i do them a little bit off the cuff but let's get back to the point would you merge this and this got balance somewhere like that it's completely out isn't it so personally no i wouldn't then let's go to the next day tuesday would you merge this no i wouldn't look balance is here balance is here i'm not going to merge them okay then we come in here and we've got this do you remember that uh not rule but guide where i said to you you might have a few days where we're imbalanced and the new information comes in and actually the whole period might be balanced so that's to me that's what's happening here and if in doubt check it see what it looks like but i can tell you just looking at this i probably would i'm gonna merge this anyway but i will check it but i just want to make my point clear to you so do you agree here we've got a composite yeah you've got individual day no balance with this and this this and this but look what happens we come in here when you look at this period as a whole what have you actually done it's balanced i'm gone anywhere so i'm gonna merge that well at least i'm gonna see what it looks like when i merge it so let's do that merge with next profile merge with next profile do you see it doesn't look right when i merge with next profile initially but when i've merged with this profile i think it looks quite good actually i think it's really good okay ideally that's there and you wouldn't want it to be but come on markets are not perfect do we have a general really strong distribution yeah and what i can assure you is i'm going to be watching this balance area months into the future because that is your camera price of it's been so long since i've done that webcam example was it 105 i think it was wasn't it 105 pound guys that's 105 pound equivalent that is a very very very strong balance area that's the market telling you that for us the e-mini s&p in this region we're happy to transact buy market orders and sell market orders are happy to transact how do we know that look how much volume built in this area okay so my point is what are you going to do when you come into this area in the future is you're going to wait you're going to build some value you're going to start to play balance so you're going to try and play trend as you may call it or imbalance you're going to play rotational balance in this area if you ever came in in the future and i'm going to show you this anyway how i mark these areas and identify them and then i leave them on my chart point is right now for task one i just want you to practice merging and getting used to it's the first time you've seen it you know let's take it step by step you know so you don't get analysis paralysis because you don't want to learn much if you do all of that see what it is if there is this option here where you've got quite a few right and either you can merge them individually but you see you can put merge profile begin and then merge profile end okay so you can do that and then we had this then we had this area come in so um in fact let's do that again it was actually this whole area wasn't it merge profile begin and that was the last one merge profile so before i do that can you see that is actually very very balanced this area this area it's great it's balanced isn't it so i'm going to merge all of these together so i'm going to go merge profile okay merge profile sorry the software had a bit of a didn't have a moment it's because i pressed begin on the same profile got a bit confused merge profile begin okay and merge profile end there you go okay so we've got that area that we were looking at before now would i merge the next step no why because that's balance there and look where's the value area where's value can you see clearly there two different areas value has moved do you remember how we said 105 oh we're now looking for has amazon changed the price and i don't want to go back to all those examples but it's important i'll show you it's moved hasn't it it's moved value has moved do you remember don't think in terms of individual price we're now thinking as price being value value has shifted it's migrated up okay can you see i'm not cherry i've basically done every single day from the 15th to the 24th i'm going to skip days i'm showing exactly what i would do and how i would identify context next day nope no merge right next day no easy no merge not skipping any days okay next day no obviously i wouldn't merge that because where's the previous value here where's value here here this is my point this is what i was trying to make before and i know i did it in a bit of a roundabout way but i hope you can actually see that was beneficial to you because the point is can you see if i had all these pre-picked examples and i got it already you wouldn't see what i experience on a daily basis i do sometimes sit here and think shall i actually let me see what was it trying to achieve okay if i merge it how does it look do you see i wanted you to see that even i face these decisions every day and if i had shown you pre-prepared examples i haven't gone through that little bit of a you know all over the place um sort of approach that i did it wouldn't have been reflective of my day my trading day you know there is never i mean when you get two days like this obviously it's great it's nice and like i said it does happen a good 50 percent of the time you come into the market and you'll notice this you've got balance and you've got balance oh easy i'll merge the two together easy don't even need to think about it fine crack on do the rest of my prep but my point is i didn't want to show you that type of stuff because it wouldn't have been reflective of the truth that's why i took my time about it i wanted to be a little bit all over the place because i wanted you to see that actually you know what that's what it's like even for envy the market isn't perfect and sometimes you do have to use your discretion generate alpha brilliant great thing not a bad thing look look for opportunities where you can spot things before anyone else and actually think outside the box and it's you know um think about it when you're at work it's actually great you look for opportunities where you can gain edge i know it sounds awful over your colleagues why so you can progress that's how it is in firms when you're self-employed doing the same thing you've got other people that are self-employed in your business you're looking for opportunities to do what do the job better than them that's why i love this stuff because i realize if there's something that's unclear i have an edge over an algorithm because an algorithm is going to get confused it's only as good as it's programmed i can actually start to think for a little bit oh maybe there's an opportunity here that people won't realize until the next day when they're actually doing it by then it's too late the crowds come in and everyone's doing it so that's why i love this stuff anyway so to the next day so literally we're just going day by day aren't we so we merge these two days am i going to merge this with this there's some overlap here well let's see i personally it's obvious that we wouldn't right because the value isn't overlapping but how can we check we can always open it out and we can actually see it here that the market came out and yeah i agree it went up but it never formed any balance here did it look at the j and k period it's all straight up it basically went imbalanced right up through it but the point was the bulk of the day what did it do balanced outside of the main balance i'm not going to merge those two it's obvious right you're not going to merge them so with these gray areas you know i'm going to repeat the point that i said before which is that um i've got no issue where there's gray areas if you merge and i don't merge and you know at the end of the day all power to you you know that's why in a professional firm not everyone makes it because people sometimes do they don't make decisions that generally the rest of the market agrees with i've obviously been making the right decisions but sometimes i get it wrong and it's okay because those days you might get it right so don't despair it's just over a period of time yeah i happen to be you know in the most humble way i mean this very good at identifying these areas over periods of time there's going to be days where the market doesn't agree with my definition of value and i'll only find that out the next day when the market comes and trades the rta session it will obviously give me that feedback in terms of actual trading but that's my point individual days don't worry too much just realize over time through your own trading the only reason i'm saying all of this is because the points where i will tell you is if you start merging this with this obviously i'm going to say okay look do you know what maybe we need to go back to the drawing board because here you've got balance here and you've got balance here why are you merging these two okay and that's not a criticism at all it's the first time you're doing it even if you're doing stuff like that it's fine my only point is i probably will be telling you look it's wrong but where you've got these gray areas and i might merge you may not merge you know as we saw before who am i to tell you you're wrong the market will tell you okay remember that don't be like shy and you know start having confidence in your abilities and looking for market feedback on that and the market will be the best judge because other people will tell you whether where you've identified their perception of value is correct or not okay so um i apologize that i went on a little bit there but i felt it was important that i say these things as they crop up in my mind so personally yeah like i said i wouldn't merge these two this to me i think it's pretty good i feel like um that area naturally we could kind of call it that area i'm going to merge these okay i'll tell you right now i'm going to merge these if you want to obviously you know at the start of your career but if you want to do all these little tests every single time that's great and in fact i'd suggest them but i will tell you i would merge these because i know when i merge these two they're going to look like a nice distribution i think and i hope i'm not wrong like i said check them do you see look at that beautiful what it is i could tell i mean obviously don't forget i've been doing this for years yeah i could tell straight away because think about it what this area doing it's just filling in that chunk isn't it i could see it straight away but that's what it was doing but that's why i always give these these guidelines to people as i say look you know what until you've seen a thousand ten thousand hundred thousand god knows how many i've seen probably hundreds of thousands i've seen of these things till you develop that obviously check them check them anyway how does it look does it look balanced yeah brilliant balance very very nice balance there so i'm going to merge those two okay so um we've basically gone so far that was balanced there that was balanced this are we agreed you wouldn't balance it okay this and this is a tricky one very very tricky one now i think i already looked at this earlier i probably would balance these and i think i did say this earlier we were looking at this section but honestly there's no right or wrong answer for me over two days again for the reasons that i described before i think that this area does fill in this area quite nicely right hopefully that's the case let's merge them together but i'll show you why you could actually sorry okay can you see that very very nice and actually the market feedback the next day was that's pretty decent isn't it because really you've got some nice morning opportunities at the rth open to play some imbalanced trades down and then obviously came back in so i do like that and i believe earlier in this section i did say that but there's no right or wrong answer okay on this one because you could also argue that do you remember what i said what's the market trying to achieve you could argue and i think very strongly and fairly that the market has rejected this value area isn't it i mean and i think the market's giving good feedback here that a lot of participants agree with you you know and you notice one of the things you can do if you don't have any composites to work off is you can just use the previous day's value okay the market kind of agreed with you it's a bit messy wasn't it well i don't know i've given you my reasons i actually think what the market was trying to achieve here is just fill in this gap it's a bit more of an advanced thinking because obviously i've been looking at this for years and i just got a feel i think i know what the market's trying to achieve here is it's trying to fill in some of this stuff what it is is i said to you before that sometimes you get profiles like this where the market will just blatantly come and fill this in but where it's not so obvious is here where actually if you think about what it's doing is that gap is actually very subtly there and what the market's done is it's just basically filled that that little section in there and that's what's happened here that's what i personally would merge it but there's no right or wrong answer you know at the end of the day if you said to me what i don't what it is is what i don't want happening and i noticed that and i said to you the failure rate was 80 to 90 percent even in professional circles when i became very senior obviously i used to have a lot of junior guys even in professional environments walk up to me and say would you would what would you do in this situation where i was trying to help out some of the younger guys and showing them what i was doing the market profile a lot of them would say to me what would you do would you merge this would you end of the day in these gray areas what ideally i want you to do is i want you to say do you know what um envy i think according to the guidelines i've given you the market's trying to achieve a shift in balance into this area so i'm not going to merge them so i can't argue with you you've given me a very good reason and you trade it that way and let's see what the market tells us the next day what what's the point of people what it is is i noticed this when people say what would you do what's your rule for merging in this to see also use an indicator where's the edge if it was obvious every algorithm in the world would be doing this and there'd be no money to make can you understand that you've got to sometimes bite the bullet and say do you know what i'm using my critical thinking the way that financial analysts read um which call them the performers and the financial statements of companies and then look for intrinsic value to the um wherever they think it is or basically price to be away aware sorry can't even speak properly away from where they think fair value is for a stock price individual stocks if you think about it company stocks people are looking at these things very subjective the best analysts are the ones that use some sort of critical thinking and look to see where they think that things are or the market may give them feedback that they were right because they identified something that maybe someone else hadn't ahead of when the rest of the market realizes it so really that's what it is it is giving you a great opportunity to do that you know when you've got some easy indicator that everyone has there's no edge if it was that obvious everyone would be using it and you'd be on a beach this stuff is giving you a great opportunity and i know i keep saying it it's just i want you to realize how golden this is as an opportunity to develop alpha as opposed to you being downbeat and thinking no you know what it's not clear i don't know what to do if it's logical and you can think of a good reason to merge merge it if it doesn't make sense to you don't merge it if you want to have a discussion with me happy to do that but it should be from a place of you know what i noticed this it wasn't very clear what do you think and i'm going to say yes good good analysis try it but like i said if you're down here and you're merging with that don't really make sense or if you're just looking for some rule for me to tell you whether these two should merge you're not going to find it you're in the wrong business and that i'm doing your favor by telling you that because no one's going to be honest with you so i gave you the reason why i would merge them you got to make that decision yourself okay and there is things that we can look at later where we can obviously look to almost split this out look split profile here do you see that and i can merge i don't need to do this right now you see i can actually start to split stuff out i'm going to show you doing this stuff but i'm going to be honest with you i did that whole process that i just showed you there about splitting letters out i did it for um i think about three years and i dropped it i don't do it anymore the reason i'm in two minds about showing you is because i want you to go on that journey and i want you to figure it out for yourself and i don't want you to do it for me i don't want you to do it for me i don't want you to do it for i want you to go on that journey and i want you to figure it out for yourself whether it works for you or not for me i just found it was he's just trying to be too precise with imprecision essentially the market's not perfect do you know what i just said you know what if it looks okay for me to merge i'll merge if it doesn't i won't merge it i don't do all this the first time i'm telling you i don't do all the splitting stuff out but i'm thinking the reason initially i thought let me show you is because i thought let me show everyone let them split stuff out go on that journey themselves and figure out whether it works for them because i did it i had the benefit of that then when i was doing this i thought um actually maybe i shouldn't because obviously i don't do it but actually i am going to show you because i do want you to do it but just not in task one let's leave that until a little bit later let's just get you merging for the time being um profiles so essentially i've merged those two so like i said it was 50 50 this i'm not going to merge the next day let's just do a few more days and then i think we're pretty much done okay so i'm going to take it up to here and i think i've pretty much covered all bases i'm gonna so this and this i'm not going to merge them this am i going to merge you with that no easy decision this am i going to merge you with that no easy decision clearly balance was here balances here i'm not going to merge them this easy decision merge them do you see a lot of the times it is easy it is easy i just wanted to show you some tough areas because when i'm not there you're going to be stuck so i thought let me show you some let me just be fair and go through them one day by one day by one day rather than just looking for particular areas and that's why i got i'm apologizing because i realized i was messing you know i was looking for stuff before but you know what at the end of the day um i wanted to show you that this is what i go through every day as a um this is the very foundation of what i'm doing every day so um so we didn't merge that we didn't merge that um potentially i could merge these three because didn't really go anywhere did it for those three days so what did i say just merge them see what it looks like does it look like it's got the symmetrical uh gaussian shape they call it do you see that do you see that it's amazing isn't it how the market does this this is auction market process this is the auction process at its finest can you see i told you i wouldn't have merged those two but um can you see how we had this and it needed to be filled in look what happened market filled it in beautifully anyway we said we'd look what the three days look like so let's merge them yeah do you see i don't like it i don't like it and i'll be honest with you i didn't like it when i um saw it anyway because uh so we had this area we've got this and this which obviously we did merge and that's why i called it three days actually it's four days you see what it is is i don't like i'll tell you why i didn't like it okay is because um you have value here you've got value here and you've got value here but can you see you've got this bit of value here and almost you could say it was here and i don't like how this is very much outside of where the main value area is you've got this little chunk here i don't like it it's very subtle you might be thinking what is he talking about it's very subtle what it is i can almost because you've got to understand i've done these probably a million times i can almost visualize how it looks when you combine them don't get me wrong i still combine them at times just to check them out why not it takes a few seconds but the point is you can kind of see you see that prominence there just didn't like it basically um you can see it really i just don't like how it this area sticks out a lot and anyway you've got another problem here to be fair even if i had merged them and looked i wouldn't yeah look at that what's the problem can you see it's two distributions so you kind of got this this which i don't like anyway because you've got this this little bit of prominence there and then this you've got can you see it's two distributions and to be honest that's an even more important reason than me just being finicky about that is essentially you've got a value area here and you've got value area here there's no merge guys right this is one of those where i probably would if you came and asked me and say should i i would say look in my opinion that's not correct it's not our it's not statistically a balanced proposition and not even statistically forget about statistically logically balance there's two balances clearly the market was balanced here and balance here there's imbalance in this area that makes sense so i'm not going to merge them however i do believe that we would start to merge it when we get into this area i do like that because if you think about it we've got um these days here now look at that it's really filling in this bit of low volume that we saw when we merged the four days together right together right so let's merge do you remember you can either do merge profile begin and then here merge profile uh end and you merge them we'll do them one by one anyway merge merge so do you remember i said i probably wouldn't merge this that i wouldn't merge it but then when you bring that in it is it should probably start to fill that in i probably even though you've still got that i'll be honest with you do you see it's very it can be quite subjective for me okay we've got this little bit that needs filling in but i kind of like it because what it is is right i like i can see what the market's going to achieve right can you see that this is what i'm saying why i don't mean this in an arrogant way actually i'm saying this and i hope you see i'm trying to help you i think this is really what differentiates sort of even people coming into professional environments and why you do have this this fact that a lot of them weren't able to apply this thinking okay and the reason i'm telling you this because i want to give an example of that type of thinking that they can't teach you okay they can't teach you that okay so let me give an example is they may be able to show you and i may be able to show you guys look market profile value this what the market's trying to achieve all this stuff we've done in ultra market theory but you know at the end of the day it's a day in the sp500 a new day and you're going to rule space like i say merge them see how they look or whatever but ultimately okay i understand when you i said here i probably wouldn't merge these because it's still quite prominent the fact that there's two profiles but then you might ask me when i merge the next profile it's still quite prominent but at the end of the day i'm also applying a bit of logic and critical thinking and saying hang on what's market been doing for four days it's gone nowhere right what's the market actually done here okay i told you i didn't like that bit sticking out at the top but what has the market clearly told me it's almost like here the market's talking to me and saying envy i agree with you that area wasn't ideal but look we're going to show you that actually the value is here because why the whole day traded in this area that i was considering for the last four days so do you see that's what i'm applying some sense that okay do you know what this market is rotational in this five-day period so i'm going to trade this day within balance of that day you know okay it wasn't ideal from a statistical perspective according to the guidelines i gave you but this is where you can add alpha because to me it's quite clear what is the market trying to do it's trying to rotate and look what happened here next day so i like i said i would merge these there's no right or wrong answer honestly if you didn't you're not going to be a failure as a trader or anything like that it's ridiculous but i'm just trying to give you an example of decisions that you can make over time that will be the difference you know if you keep doing this over and over and over again obviously you're going to be able to generate great alpha by trading this day it's a rotational date right these are going to be my contextual levels that i'm going to be looking at to trade off so you know if i get some excess here some absorption i'm going to be looking if i get excess here absorption i'm going to be looking to do mean reversion can you see that in these textual areas so look that's enough there um you know we can do some examples as well you know we can do some examples as well in fact what i'm going to do after this is let me just go back to the slide make sure that i've covered everything and in fact what i haven't covered is this and i haven't covered this okay so i'm going to end this section in a second let me just set up this rth chart and show you something that i used to do to help guide me i don't do it anymore it's up to you if you want to do it i'm not going to use it and show you because i don't use it but i'll show you what i used to do early in my career sometimes which was kind of helpful um for me anyway but um i don't know i don't really use it anymore so it's up to you whether you use it or not but so give me a second let me just bring that up okay so what i've done here is i've loaded up here an rth chart remember i said you can use the basic rth chart so you can see it's got gaps basically here to here open to close and basically if you think about it what is this chart this is the market profile isn't it period because as i said it's um the rth so all this represents each market profile period if you think about it what we've just been looking at and i hope i've got these dates lined up correctly so can you see here thursday the 7th is that it's basically this isn't it and then the next day is there and so on and so forth so basically one of the things that i used to do is you know if i wasn't you know if i wasn't sure about particular you know how i said that um you know i would merge these days even though it didn't look quite clear when you merge them well let's have a look so what i would do is i'll say look the 7th to the 13th is this 7th to the 13th so can you see but you know basically it's about as clear you're gonna get balance all right i don't actually use this but i guess it kind of shows my point that i was trying to make to you about why i was thinking to myself hang on well i don't care if my profile looks a little bit wasn't that bad but you see my point i'm going to use a bit of logic here and say well actually what we actually been doing for these days and you can see it's very clear on rth chart so you know i'll probably put this in the template if you want i'll give it to you you can just have a look at the individual days and sometimes by looking at what the price is doing and what it's trying to achieve makes it quite gets you away sometimes from being too rules-based is my point so i used to find that useful i don't use it anymore but like i said i want you to go through the journey so by all means if you want to use that use it i don't but um thought i'd give you that little tip no one told me to do that just seemed logical to me let me just go and have a look what does it look like on a scrunched up um price chart obviously no indicators guys yeah just literally pure value price action kind of stuff we saw on the amazon um stuff i was showing you with the bread and the Cadbury's cream eggs and do you remember we had price literally just going like that and i said well do you know what values kind of 70 in that period and it's a different perspective isn't it it's like it's nice to look at two perspectives and it can kind of you know sometimes you can get start to get a bit too stuck in your ways of one and i've used to find this really useful many years ago i'll be honest with you i dropped it now i just like i said i've obviously developed that critical thinking now but you know it takes everyone time and it's good i think it's good to look at it in that way sometimes if it's not clear to you then you can look at that but i don't do it anymore but again like i said free tip you know um for me to give you and then the final thing we are going to end now is long term versus short term the reason i put that there is because basically i have no idea again i don't want to just cherry pick examples i want to see if i can actually find you a good example of this uh just undo all the mergers in the chart this what what it is is you'll get like long periods of time when they're in this like uh sorry pardon my mouse has given up sorry my mouse had a moment there um what it is is you'll find um period you'll find long periods you'll find long periods of time where um basically the market won't really go anywhere but i'm not going to merge all that area because of my um time frame perspective so just give me a second i'll i will there must be somewhere on here where we've had that type of period probably do need to you know like i said i like to look at this stuff in blocks all right there you go there's a good sort of example of it but we'll have to scrunch it up a little bit right so actually i'll have to move this because i think my head probably that should be about right perfect so look um this area here um because the market didn't really go anywhere let's let me do that again you can see from a sort of if you were intraday player you probably have balance here then you have balance here a couple days you have balance here three days then you might merge this whole area here and then you'd have some balance here right because i'm intraday player i'm looking for what day opportunities to play from there down to there that's a good range 10 points you know 30 40 ticks in the es and then i've got two days here where i might be looking to obviously play this range um or if i'm going in balance i might just be looking to do that the thing is we've got to realize is actually to some people that entire thing is balance okay do i merge all of that no i don't but there's nothing wrong with it because if you think about it that's actually balance right for think about this whole area here just balance isn't it for someone for someone with a longer term perspective so if you're a longer term um trader you know nothing wrong with thinking you know should i actually look at what is it up to there i've never done it i don't know how it looks like it's not bad you know it's not bad actually think about it and look the market feedback was it agreed i know that you've got a lot of areas that need filling in but look at the end of the day it's not it's not bad to be honest that that top area probably isn't that's funny so when i say top area the value area low is pretty accurate right area high is probably a bit higher somewhere like there it's actually pretty accurate and if you think about it what's the market done it's rejected this area of balance fundamental shift and look what's happened straight out of this area and actually come back and tested it so some great opportunities to actually play this down if you're a longer term player is my point so what it is is i just that's why i put that on the slide because i just thought there might be some people who um identify you know i said that do you remember i did say that that probably could be a little bit all right whatever it was and look the market agrees look there some great opportunities to play the edges market feedback god i've never you know i've never done this before as you saw i was looking for examples randomly some cherry bit first time i've looked at this if you're a higher time frame as you call it in retail i call it obviously a different perspective i saw there's a word for it's called otf if you read the um market profile books i told you about other time frame participants but actually for me it's more um you know guys that are like real money funds people who are playing longer term strategies even longer term hedge fund strategies that are playing this but clearly look do you remember the edges you and i we might be playing do you see imbalance here someone on a you know bigger perspective they wouldn't they'll be playing this as a rotational play right up to the other side so i just wanted to make that distinction obviously decide what you are i personally wouldn't do a merge like this like i told you i'm a it's all perspective i'm obviously an intraday person so for me i'm going to look at that as one i'm going to look at it as you know a few days balance so balance here oh god sorry balance here balance here balance here balance here where someone else look at that whole area is balance is my point and i just showed you so look that's the end task one i want you to spend a couple of weeks what i'm going to do straight after this is i'm going to obviously show you how the splits can work and i'll do a little bit more with um you know maybe some s&p and also definitely crude oil and show you how i would necessarily approach merges and you can have a look at that um and that will then form part of task two where i'll show you how i actually identified them using this horizontal square which will then be shown on my chart um so i'm going to show that to you as a supplement to this but essentially this is the end of part b start to just merge profiles get used to the software incredible software can't believe this thing how much it costs because i'm telling you to do this type of work on market profile even on cqg which is several hundred dollars you know up to a thousand dollars a month if you want to spend it it doesn't come close to this this thing is instant and it allows you to merge profiles in such a easy manner you know um so yeah enjoy it and look finally i do want to apologize because i feel like i've been a little bit disjointed but not in a bad way in this and you've got to remember this isn't theory anymore this is practice so i hope you can appreciate that rather than me going away and finding a list of 10 examples and then i can show you everything i've done it on the spot so i can show you what i go through every day it hasn't been in my opinion disjointed actually it's been better that i've had to be a little bit aimlessly looking around for things and because that's how it is in trading you know don't let any educator or whatever give you cherry-picked examples and have them prepared it's all nonsense okay at the end of the day market's going to be different every day and that's why i thought you know what let me just go and look for stuff whilst i'm actually filming because then they'll really get a feel for how it can be difficult and subjective every day but a great opportunity to generate alpha so let's get you merging see how you get on with that obviously get you doing that no necessarily time limits maybe a couple of weeks or whatever and then i'm going to introduce obviously vwap i'll try and put some more examples straight after this but don't wait for that there'll be a template and yeah just get cracking with letters blocks whatever and then see how you get on cheers guys

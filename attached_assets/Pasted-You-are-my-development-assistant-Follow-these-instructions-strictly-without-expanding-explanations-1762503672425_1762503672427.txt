You are my development assistant. Follow these instructions strictly, without expanding explanations unless I ask.

GOAL: Fix and streamline my IBKR trading system for consistent operation.

PRIORITY TASKS (execute in this order):

1. **Check Environment**
   - Identify whether the current session is running in Replit’s dev environment or from my local ChromeOS Flex folder.
   - Print the absolute path of the current working directory and confirm the active environment.

2. **Startup Script (for dummies)**
   - Create a clear `start.sh` script that:
     a. Activates the correct environment (virtual env or Replit runner)
     b. Launches the IBKR connector and the trading engine
     c. Displays clear terminal feedback (e.g., "System running", "Connection OK")
     d. Handles automatic reconnection if localhost disconnects.

3. **Fix Localhost Disconnect Issue**
   - Diagnose why the IBKR localhost connection keeps turning off/on.
   - Add a stable reconnection routine or a retry loop with a short delay and clear logs.
   - Make sure the connector keeps the session alive unless manually stopped.

4. **Clean System Root**
   - Delete or archive any unused or duplicate files, especially from old IBKR connector builds.
   - Keep only the active local version required for current operations.
   - Maintain a clean folder structure (e.g., `/src`, `/data`, `/logs`, `/config`, `/archive`).

5. **Static vs Dynamic Data Logic Review**
   - Review the system logic to check if the code distinguishes between static and dynamic data as described in the Vadeera course.
   - If not, implement or note how to integrate that distinction (e.g., static = configs/market rules; dynamic = live price data, positions, etc.).

6. **Output**
   - After completing all steps, print a summary of:
     - Environment type
     - Path to `start.sh`
     - Number of files removed/kept
     - Connection test result
     - Whether static/dynamic data logic exists or needs addition

Keep responses short, technical, and actionable. Do not overexplain.

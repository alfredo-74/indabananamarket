All right guys, so in this module we are literally going to get the depth of market, rip it apart and reconstruct it. We're going to start everything from scratch. Why are we going to do that? Well, guys, if many of you are like how I was when I first started out in a professional trading environment and I was shown things like bids, offers, market orders, limit orders, listing orders, four columns, which is many more columns than I was ever used to seeing on a chart, demand and supply, and so on and so forth, guys, I was completely lost, you know, first couple of weeks. So I'm going to go on the assumption that like everyone may have got everything I've said so far, but I'm going to assume that there's a lot of you that haven't understood a lot of it or any of it, and I don't want you to worry because that's the purpose of this module and it's one of the most, or this particular section of the module, it's one of the most important sections in the entire course. It will show you, and you're not going to believe this right now, but how volume profile is constructed, how the footprint is constructed, and it's the very basis for how I trade the entire market, be it foreign exchange, be it the futures market, equities, oil, et cetera, et cetera. So what you've got to understand, guys, is that there is a depth of market for every single product and service in the entire world, and right now, you probably think I'm crazy, but by the end of this, I can assure you, you're going to be sitting there laughing to yourself, thinking, oh my God, I've really been duped. The retail industry has really duped me into thinking that it's these squiggly little things on my line that's driving it. You're going to realize that the factors that drive the price on your screen are no different to the factors that are driving everything around you. It's just not obvious because the things around you don't have a visible depth of market, whereas in the, obviously, futures market and even in every single asset class, a depth of market, albeit not visibly, does exist. There's availability, there's demand, and I'm going to show you and actually build a depth of market for the banana market here that they're identical. To do that, I just need to quickly show you what a wholesale fruit and vegetable market looks like. The reason I've chosen this market, guys, I could have chosen any market in the world. In the initial module when we were doing our business plans, it made sense to use the examples of locations. The thing about those type of products and services is they tend to, at least traditionally, be one way. Let me give you an example. Let's say you're a personal trainer or a hairdresser. Would you agree typically you're going to walk into a shop, there'll be a supply in terms of availability of hairdressers, that's the supply, you're going to buy that, right, and you're going to have a haircut. What you're not going to do, which you typically do in a wholesale market, is you're not going to purchase that haircut, store it as inventory, and sell it to someone else. It's a two-way market, guys. But I don't want you to think that it doesn't exist or isn't possible. It is possible. It's possible to have a depth of market for haircuts if you really wanted it. It's just not practical in the real world, and that's why those types of markets, you know, restaurants are another one, meals, you typically go in, you buy French fries and you eat them. You don't sell them to someone else, but if you wanted to, you could, and you could create a depth of market. It's just that it's an illiquid market, something we talked about in module one. Liquid markets are things like wholesale markets where, so for example here, and I'm quite familiar with the fruit and veg market because my family has quite a big business in the fruit and veg. Maybe that's why I'm a trader, but it's fruit and veg, guys. It could be wine, it could be fish. These wholesale markets exist for clothes, for everything, and what you typically see, you'll see individual traders here, and then you'll see large, you can almost think of these like institutions, and they've got inventory, right? So can you see here, there's a whole pallet, it's called a pallet, it looks like oranges to me. Let's say there's 100, so that's almost 100 units, now that will have a price, won't it? This chap here will be selling it at $11 each, and buyers will come in, they'll buy that. What he may decide is that, oh, I'm going to sell my first 50 at 11, right, and if demand exceeds supply, the last 50, I'm going to raise my price to 12. So can you see, guys? Demand and supply interaction are causing price changes. What this chap could then do, and that's why it's a two-way market, he will buy this, and he will walk down there, and he'll realize, he may think to himself, right, inventory of oranges is very short in this market. If I buy it for 11, I might be able to sell it for 12 up here, right, guys? So I'm going to show you, right now it's not very clear how this can be put into a depth of market. If you really wanted, with four columns, and if we just remind ourselves of what a depth of market looks like, so that is actually the treasury market, which is what we're going to use, but it's identical to, if you look here, Eurodollar, right? So that's the Eurodollar market, that's availability, and then that's almost like the actual, the market orders, the demand, actual transactions taking place. So this will make sense in a moment when I actually start the example. I just want to explain to you a little bit visually why we're using a fruit and vegetable market, and then on top of that, guys, it can be any product you like it to be. So I've arbitrarily chosen bananas, we're all familiar with them, but guys, it could be apples, see some boxes of apples there, it could be potatoes, there's probably potatoes somewhere around here, cucumbers, it could be anything, you can see there's so many products here. Each one of these will have a depth of market, and right now, you're going to laugh when I tell you this, but guys, the price of oranges, or I think that's potatoes there, guys, the factors that are driving this are the same factors that are driving the price of, this could be Pound Dollar, this could be Eurodollar, this could be US Treasuries, which is what we're going to be looking at, and so on and so forth. So I've set the scene now, visually, and I'll just quickly take you to the depth of market for bananas, so you can see it here. Now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to set up the depth of market for the US Treasuries, I'm going to bring it across here, and I'm going to show you exactly the similarities, how identical it is, and what I need you to take away from this module, or this part of this module, is essentially the difference between market orders, limit orders, which you see on this column here, these are market orders, just the difference between those two guys, because it's these columns that will end up, I'm just going to bring that Eurodollar chart back, so there's Eurodollar, and this is the US Treasury market, as I showed previously, it's just a different product, it doesn't matter, it's these market orders that is going to determine volume profile, footprint, and so on and so forth. So that's why it's really important by the end of this module, you understand the difference between market and limit orders, and you will understand it, because I'm going to break it down and make it very simple, and just remember that this is what feeds into volume profile, all volume tools really, footprint as well, and as you know, volume profile and even VWAP, although we're not going to get into VWAP until the advanced course, but it's these two columns guys, that's what's causing these to change value all the time. Right now, may not make complete sense, but by the end of this, I can assure you, and I'm actually going to build a volume profile, why this is, so really focus on these two things, market orders, limit orders, and how they're interacting, and they're causing price to change. So let's get on with the example, I'm just going to clear that, and I'm going to bring the depth of market across. Okay guys, so here is the depth of market, which I'm just going to zoom into, because it's a little bit small, to make it easier for you to see, now this is actually the US treasury market, but don't be alarmed, we're actually doing you a favor, because you're going to thank me for it later, hopefully you can see that, I'll just zoom in a little bit more, now there's a specific reason why I'm using this market over other ones you might be familiar with, because it's a little bit of a thicker market, that'll make sense in a moment what I mean by that, but basically it's a very, very liquid market, it moves very slowly, and therefore it's much easier for me to do the teaching off of, because things like euro dollar, pound dollar, crude oil, guys, the markets are so thin, they'll be jumping around very, very quickly, and it'll be very difficult for me to obviously teach you properly, so therefore that's why I say, I'm more than happy to teach you on them, but you're not going to really learn anything, so like I said, you'll thank me for it later. I'll show you the euro dollar market, just to put you at ease, that is exactly the same thing, makes no difference, but the purpose of me putting these side by side, is I just want to show you the banana market, depth of market, is identical guys, to any other financial market, depth of market, so that's euro dollar there, just so you can comfort yourself that it's identical to the treasury market, it's exactly the same, we kind of saw it here, didn't we, if I just scroll back, you can see all the depth of markets guys, they're identical, same columns, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 columns in the S&P, 6 columns in US treasury, 6 columns in pound dollar, 6 columns in euro dollar, okay, they're all identical, and we've got 6 columns in the banana market, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so as we can see, they're all identical, now first thing to notice is, truth picked up on it, can you see how it's populated in this column, but this is all blank guys, why is that, again, identical to financial markets, on a weekend, this will all be empty, okay guys, and for an hour a day, the market shuts, the futures market, it's a halting period, that the exchange shuts down for an hour, they reset things, etc, etc, inventory goes away, and it's blank exactly like this is blank, same thing, volume profile resets, bids and offers all disappear, market orders clear out, so what you've got to understand guys is, would you agree that on a weekend, a market like this is going to be shut, there's not going to be anyone there guys, there's not going to be any inventory, it's going to be blank, right, then, and in fact the fruit and veg market does operate, it opens quite early, say about 11 in the morning on a Sunday, sorry, 11pm on a Sunday, so same thing as, this is UK time, same thing as the financial markets, open around Asian time, right, so Sunday night, UK time, they're opening up, so essentially, this will be blank, and then it will start populating, I'm going to go through things very very slowly, so I apologise for the pace, but again, like I said, I wish someone had explained this to me very very slowly, instead of just sticking me on a depth of market, it would have been helpful, so I want to try and explain this comprehensively as possible, so we're going to take things slowly, so just be patient if you get it, if you don't, then obviously keep rewinding and going back to things, but I'm going to explain it very very slowly, and show you how there is absolutely no difference between the banana wholesale market and the financial market, so again, let's put them side by side, and what I'm going to do first is I'm going to populate the banana market, guys, the banana market's just opened, boom, people have just turned up, right, so can you see now, it's populated exactly like the financial markets are, US Treasuries, Euro dollar, you can see it's populated, right, and you can see here, what I mean by thick and thin is, inventory, guys, look at this, you've got a thousand, and actually right now as I record this, you've got this coronavirus stuff going on to the market, even in Treasuries is thinner than it normally is, you'd have 4,000 contracts here in supply on the offer and the bid side, and in Euro dollar, maybe slightly more than what you're seeing here, maybe up to 80 or 100, right now you're seeing a very thin market, but look at it relatively, look guys, on some of these bids, you've got 1,200 contracts, on the Euro dollar you've got 28, it's a very thin market, again, that may not make sense to you, but we're going to explain that in a moment, but now let's compare the columns, guys, so as I said to you, it's incredibly important that we get you thinking in terms of what exactly, let me just get this correct, guys, and I won't change it again, and I'll just keep it there, okay, so I'm going to keep that there permanently now, and apologies, I just got to open up my pen as well, so I can actually start marking this stuff for you guys, excellent, okay, so what I want to do first is, I just want to go through each column, and the six columns that I've mentioned, and show you how they are identical to the six columns in a depth of market, a financial depth of market, so I'm going to start with price, because it's what everyone knows and is used to, okay, so you've got the bid, and you've got the offer, or you call it the ask on a retail platform, so what exactly is that, why is it that you may not be familiar with exactly what that is, it's because you're used to seeing it horizontally, guys, on a retail platform, okay, so if we bring Euro dollar across, can you see there, 1.11.42, guys, and 1.11.41.5, okay, so same thing, bid and offer, so you've got 1.11.42, 4.0, and 1.11, well, actually, it would be, pardon me, on your platform, it would actually be this way, wouldn't it, 1.11.41.5, 1.11.42, right, so the point is, you're seeing the bid and offer that we see on a depth of market, you're seeing it horizontally, guys, on a depth of market, all it is is vertical, so can you see that 1.11.45, that would be your bid on a retail platform, right, and 1.11.42 would be the ask, so that's all that is, guys, is the bid and the ask, but all it is is vertical, just to make it easier to keep all the columns aligned, et cetera, et cetera, that's how it is on a depth of market, you're just going to have to get used to it, but my point is this, it's exactly the same as a banana market, depth of market, guys, so what does that actually mean, though, would you agree, on your retail platform, if you want to sell Eurodollar, you would sell at 1.11.41.5, if you wanted to buy Eurodollar, guys, you would do 1.11.42, anyone that's used a retail platform has seen this, guys, no different to what you're seeing here, it's just a bid in a banana box and an offer in a banana box, if you wanted to sell bananas, you'd have to pay $10, if you wanted to buy bananas, you'd have to pay $11, okay, like I said, I'm going to keep repeating myself a few times, because obviously it's so important, this particular part of the module, that you get it, because it's going to help you understand the volume profile footprint, so on and so forth, so, you know, I really can't repeat this stuff enough, in my opinion, and then here in the treasury market, guys, it's exactly the same, bid and offer, which is the ask, now, I apologise, my version of Sierra Chart is not the latest version, I've been a bit lazy and not updated it, but, so you'll see 28 here twice, but it's just because the treasury market moves in half tick increments, so, honestly, it makes no difference, so that's 28, that's 28 and a half, that's 29, 29 and a half, 30, 30 and a half, guys, in the financial markets, in institutions, things are moving so fast, people won't even say 134, 29, 134, 28, they'll just say 28 and a half, 29, where's your bid in treasuries, and someone said 28 and a half, same in Eurodollar, guys, people don't say 1.11, 41 and a half, if you're on an institutional desk and someone says where's your bid, it's 41 and a half, or where's the bid, 41 and a half, where's the offer, 42, so, again, it's exactly the same here, 29 is the offer, 28 and a half is the bid, so that's the price, guys, the buying price and the selling price, right, which, again, you're very familiar with, so buy bananas at 11, sell bananas at 10, buy Eurodollar at 42, sell Eurodollar at 41 and a half, and, again, it's just flipped, so that you're seeing it vertically, that's all, okay, so that's column dealt with, next column, guys, supply, from now on, I don't think I've mentioned it before, but it's really the first time we're looking at depth, guys, this is supply, okay, and this is supply, and this is demand, okay, so what exactly is happening here, it's exactly what's happening here, guys, on the depth of market, so this banana market's opened, right, as I said, it's suddenly populated, guys, four people have turned up at the open and decided to offer, that's why it's called the offer, for sale, offer, for sale, 11 dollars, and even people use the ask, they've decided to ask for 11 dollars for a box of bananas, right, what these guys are doing, guys, is they're bidding in the sense, they want to buy, right, when you want to buy something on eBay, what do you do, you place a bid, so that's why it's called a bid, these guys have turned up in the morning and said, look, I want to buy bananas at 10, these guys have said, well, okay, good luck to you, because I'm only willing to offer them to you at 11, okay, so that's supply, guys, this is the supply of sales, this is the supply of buyers, people get confused by me saying supply, thinking this is supply, but you're just going to have to get used to it, the fact that most liquid marketplaces are two-way, wholesale, liquid wholesale markets in the world are two-way markets, the reason why people get confused a lot by bids and offers being supply is if you think about it, people are so used to buying things, demand and supply being one way, so gym memberships, what do you do, guys, you buy it, what does the gym do, sell it, so the gym's a supplier, you're the buyer, but the reality is, other examples, just very quickly, hairdressers, you go to a hairdresser, you buy a haircut, you don't buy it and then sell it, but the reality is you could, but it's a very illiquid marketplace, it'll be difficult for you, guys, if you went to a hairdresser, bought a haircut and then stood outside the hairdressers and said, I'm selling a haircut for this place, guys, people aren't going to buy it from you, they're just going to go straight to the hairdressers, it's a very illiquid marketplace, A, because they're going to go straight past you, but B, more importantly, guys, how many people are going to be walking past wanting a haircut, not very many, it's a very illiquid marketplace, but financial markets, banana markets, chocolate wholesale markets, wine markets, wholesale markets, guys, crisps, whatever, so many items in the wholesale market are being bought and sold constantly, so you're just going to have to get your head around the fact that there's not only a supply of sellers, there's a supply of buyers, so again, if you wanted to sell euro dollar, do you agree, you need to have a supply of buyers, guys, it's as simple as that, it's because it's a two-way market, you want to sell as well as buy, then you're just going to have to get your head around the fact that there needs to be supply on both sides, inventory, supply of buyers, supply of sellers, okay, so that's all this is, four people willing to buy, supply of buyers, four people willing to sell, okay, now, let's have a look at the depth of market, guys, exactly the same thing, supply columns, 41 people willing to buy US treasuries at 20.5, 1,165 people willing to sell US treasuries at 29, no difference to the banana market, right, so far identical, now, there is a key point just to mention here and it's applicable to all markets, of course, for simplicity, we're just assuming that each one of these people has one item, here, we're assuming that each one of these people only wants to buy or sell one contract, the reality is that's not going to be the case, guys, you see here the number 41, more than likely, that could be one institution wanting to buy 41 contracts or this could be one institution wanting to sell, excuse me, 1,165 or it could be, you know, it could be two people wanting to buy 20 and another guy wanting to buy 21, so it makes it up to 41, and guys, exactly the same in Eurodollar, yeah, just so you can see, it doesn't matter that I'm showing you the treasury market, ideally, I want to show you the pound dollar, the Eurodollar market, but guys, it's the first time you've seen this, you're going to see it moving up and down like a yo-yo, it's going to make no sense to you, it's just no point in showing you this market, so here you've got 9 people willing to buy, 9 people willing to sell Eurodollar, exactly the same thing, no difference, doesn't matter what it is, stocks, bonds, oils, commodities, foreign exchange, it's all the same, you're going to have a depth of market with a supply, inventory, which then demand will need to interact with for the price to move, so let's come back to this example, so we've dealt with those columns, now these columns, guys, are demand, okay, actual transactions taking place, and they're recorded in this column, I'm not going to explain that in a moment, but you can see already some numbers here, I don't want to explain it right now, because I'm going to fast forward this example, I'm actually going to have this as an interactive example in the banana market, and these columns are going to start making sense to you as we go along, so I'm going to clear everything, and the banana market is open, and we're going to start the banana market, so let's just remind ourselves exactly what's going on here at the opening of the banana market, guys, you've got 4 people on the bid at 10, 4 people on the offer at 11, right, what exactly does that mean? What that means is that this banana market, the big wholesale market that you saw has just opened up, you've walked in and essentially there's 4 people who are advertising themselves as buyers, and there's 4 people who are advertising themselves as sellers, right, so the problem is though, the prices are different, so the buyers are saying, look, we're willing to buy bananas today at 10, the sellers are saying, well, good luck to you, we're willing to sell them to you, but only at 11, now let's imagine that's you here, okay, would you agree that unless you increase your price that you're willing to buy at to 11, you're not going to get a transaction, and unless this seller decreases his price that he's willing to accept, guys, there's not going to be any transactions taking place today, either the buyer, you or whoever, it could be anyone, or the seller, seller has to lower his price or the buyer has to increase his price, guys, this is what's happening all day long in the financial market, you'll have supply meets supply, guys, it doesn't matter if you're walking to Walmart, Costco, Tesco, any wholesale supermarket or something similar, guys, it doesn't matter if there's 10,000 bars of chocolate on the shelf, 1,000 bars, that's supply, right, if no one comes in and actually buys the chocolate, guys, that chocolate ain't going nowhere, you're going to be stuck there, same thing, unless someone actually on the buy side stop being so stubborn, moves up and says, all right, I'll pay up, or someone on the sell side moves down and says, fine, I'll accept a lower price, guys, nothing's going to happen and that's why this column is so important, it's the actual transactions taking place, it's demand, whereas here you've only got supply, I'm just going to denote it as S and S, so anyway, an hour passes, okay, and just probably important before I move on to the next step that I just showed you that it's exactly the same in financial markets as what I've just shown here, so if you look here, these 41 guys, right, at 28 and a half, 41 guys at 28 and a half are willing to buy treasury notes, 1,165 guys are willing to sell treasury notes at 29, guys, if these 41, one of them doesn't step up and say, fine, I'll pay 29, or if this guy doesn't say, fine, I'll accept 28 and a half, would you agree, nothing is going to happen in this column, nothing's going to happen, it's obvious, right, the exchange is not going to receive any market transaction, as far as the exchange is looking down, nothing's actually happened today in the market unless one of these sides moves, so, and it's exactly the same in Eurodollar, I'll just quickly show you, for the sake of completion, if you look at Eurodollar, 14 buyers at 43, 18 sellers at 43 and a half, right, unless, guys, one of these buyers steps up and says, do you know what, I'll accept that price for a purchase, i.e., I'll pay up, or this seller says, do you know what, I'm willing to sell Eurodollar at 43 and moves down, i.e., eating into the supply, the buy side supply, guys, this price is not going to move, it's going to stay static all day long, so let's just clear that out, now, this is a really crucial point to understand because on your chart, it's a big piece of information you're missing, guys, let's say, I believe, as you know, on a financial market, there's no single price, there's a bid and an offer, there's always two prices, but for simplicity's sake, on a futures market institutional platform, usually, it can be the last transacted price, it can also be the bid price, on a retail platform, it's typically the bid price, for the sake of keeping a single line, by default, you just see the bid on your chart, well, guys, here, the bid is $10, right, for one hour, guys, a whole hour, I don't care if you've got candlestick charts or whatever you're using, if you've got one-minute candles, 61-minute candles, it's going to be flat, one-hour candles, it's going to be flat, guys, the whole chart is just going to be flat, unless you, in this banana market, move up and say, fine, I'll accept and pay 11, place a market order, demand, well, this guy places a market order, demand, and says, fine, I'm willing to accept $10 for my box of bananas, same thing in Eurodollar, same thing in Treasuries, as I saw, we can understand, guys, I don't care if the RSI is at the lowest point in history of divergence, and you've got some moving average down there, trend line, guys, take all that stuff, go and find the nearest dustbin and put it in there, because if you look at that stuff in a professional trading environment, guys, you're going to not last a week, why? Because this is what is driving the market, guys, can you see, you're not seeing this on a chart, and this is why most professional firms will say, look, dump the chart, don't even need to look at it for a good few months, I actually think a couple of weeks is fine, for reasons that I'll keep going over in future modules, but essentially, what you need to understand, guys, is unless interaction of demand and supply happens in a certain way, price is not going to change, why is that? Because if there's supply at 11, and no one buys that supply, guys, what's happening to the price? It's going to stay exactly the same, so anyway, it's been an hour, then it's been two hours, right, guys, very, very stubborn buyers and sellers today in the market, very stubborn banana seller, very stubborn banana buyer, you, you're being very stubborn, it's now been two hours, and let's say your boss phones you and says, look, your name's John, he says, John, we've got a customer order for this box of bananas, you've been in the market two hours, where are you, what are you doing? And you say, I haven't bought it yet, boss, I'm waiting for my bid to get hit at 10, and he says, look, John, just pay up, get the hell out of there, pay up, guys, it used to happen to me all the time, it's an institutional term, when I was in the institutional desk, and I wanted to buy something, and I was sitting on the bid, if I was being stubborn, my boss would walk over and say, pay up, Envy, just pay up, what does that mean? Increase your price, place a market order, become the demand side of the equation, become aggressive, lift supply up, take supply at 11 out, pay up in price, okay, so you listen to your boss now, two hours later, you walk over to this guy, and you say, fine, you win, I need that box of bananas, I'll pay you 11, he's happy, okay, so a transaction takes place. Finally, do you see, guys, for two hours, it doesn't matter if there's 100,000 supply here and 100,000 supply of bananas at 11, and it's changing, and you're going to see on the depth of market, these columns are changing all the time, doesn't actually record anything here until a transaction takes place, until someone decides to change their price, and a market order happens, and prices won't change, regardless of what happens in supply, it's to do with demand, so anyway, in this occasion, you step up, and you pay 11, okay, so you've got your banana now, and you disappear, he's got his, he's happy, but where does he get transacted? So you're going to now see the actual inside columns of the depth of market populate, because an actual transaction's taking place, you're going to see a one pop up there, which you see there, okay, and there's your volume profile, one transaction took place on the ledger, volume profile, whatever you want to call it, and don't forget, you're now gone, you're happy, you've got long, he's got short, so even though it says one, don't forget, every transaction has a buyer and a seller, the reason it gets recorded here is because it's a market order placed on behalf of the aggressive participant, what does that mean? Well, guys, who changed their price? The buyer, why is that important? Why do I care about that more than the fact this guy got short? Well, I care a lot because you just walked into the market, guys, in this banana market, I'm watching you, I'm looking at you from afar, right, and I'm thinking, oh, John over there, he was willing to buy a 10, all of a sudden, he's willing to buy 11, he must know something, maybe this market's about to go up, do you see? I'm more curious about the fact that you were willing to raise your price than this guy who was just willing to sit there passively and accept it, so therefore, this is a column, like I said, I'm heavily watching, probably 95, maybe even 99% of the time, oversupply, I'm looking at demand, this will be recorded in the footprint, and I'm going to show you in the next module, the footprint module, exactly how this shows up in the footprint, but it's basically this column is the footprint, and then volume profile obviously gets transacted there, so let's just clear these guys out, because don't forget, he's now happy, he sold his bananas, he might have gone home for the day, you've got your bananas and you've disappeared for the day to deliver it to a customer, so we'll just clear both these guys out, you see, they're gone now, but look, guys, price still hasn't changed, why is that? Supply, you've still got supply at 11, right, three people still willing to sell, and you've still got three people willing to buy, so actually, nothing has changed in terms of the price, but why is that important to me? Because if I buy, I'm only going to make money if the price changes, so yeah, I've got a good piece of information that one aggressive participant has placed a market order to buy bananas, same thing I'm going to show you here in a moment on the depth of market, but the point is the price hasn't changed, so in our retail platform where we've got the price of euro, dollar, or whatever it is, it's still a flat price, guys, right, for that two hours, two and a half hours it took for the first transaction to place, guys, the price is flat, and nothing has changed, so can you see it's all demand and supply, if only one box is bought, demand, there's still plenty of supply, the price isn't going to change, you're going to have to clear out the supply, you're going to have to buy all the bananas before you start moving up to 12, so let's watch the passage of time now again, so what happens? Let's say another, you know, it's been two, two and a half hours, guys, another couple of hour passes, as I said, wow, very, very stubborn market today, and I'm going to show you the same thing happening in the depth of market, euro, dollar, treasuries, any financial market, it happens, so this guy's next in line, you know, maybe he's a colleague of yours, and maybe he didn't have a client order for a box of bananas, maybe he was happy to sit there and not raise his price in terms of his buying price to 11, and he just said, look, I'm happy to just buy at 10, and if I don't get it at 10, I don't care, I'm willing to go home for the day, and this guy, who's a seller, guys, it's now been, what, two, two and a half hours, another hour, maybe another hour on top of that, talking four, five hours now, market might be about to shut, he's getting nervous thinking, boy, maybe halfway through the day, you know, and he's getting nervous thinking, well, we're already halfway through the day, what if I get stuck with this? Fine, I give in, he walks over and says, you know what, here you go, you can have my box of bananas at 10, you win, so he says, great, but you see, it's an aggressive transaction, guys, he's lowered his price this time, do you remember before, the buyer, you, had to raise the price that you were willing to buy at, that's why it got recorded as a buy, because you became aggressive and pressed the buy button on the market order, here, although this guy's got long, he's actually pressed buy, what happened, someone hit sell and sold to him and lowered their price, so you're going to see it recorded here as a sell transaction, which will get recorded with the exchange, it doesn't mean that only someone sold, it means that someone made the decision to sell to a buyer, rather than the buyer making the decision to buy from the seller, so hopefully this isn't too confusing for you, but once, I promise you, once you've, you know, opened up your depth of market and watched this happen a few times, it will become like second nature, but my point is here, that the same thing is happening in a banana market, apple market, pear market, chocolate market, wine market, whatever you want to call it, it is actually demand that needs to eat into supply for the price to change, because even though now what you see is the sell took place, this guy gets cleared out, right, he's happy, he wanted to buy, he got $10 for his purchase, as in he paid $10, and this guy got $10, but he wanted $11, but look, he got rid of his inventory, so he's gone, maybe happy, maybe not as happy as his colleague was, because obviously his colleague got $11, he's having to accept $10, but then he's stuck around for much longer, and eventually paid down this time, so he's gone for the day, and he's gone for the day, right, so we're going to clear those out, just clear all that out, okay, sorry, there you go, so initially, as I said, you're going to see the one appear here, right, and there's your volume transaction, because these two transacted, and look, they disappeared, so that's the point, so this guy paid down one market order, market order column, and this guy paid up, okay, so you got long at $11, your colleague got long at $10, okay, so he might be a bit happier than you, but it's just the way it is, and what happened here, the first seller got short at $11, this seller got short at $10, right, so he might be, you know, a bit more disappointed than his early seller, but whatever, it is what it is, he got to sell, and he went home, so can you see, guys, the dynamic has suddenly changed, before we had an aggressive buyer, now we've got an aggressive seller, so it's kind of one all, and that's why the market order column is crucial, because it's telling me and showing me the aggression from both sides is kind of equal at the moment, and just notice finally, before I start and hit play on the depth of market, that guys, there's still supply on both sides, so the price is going to stay the same, albeit less supply, there's still supply on both sides, so we haven't actually moved for four and a half hours on this chart that we were showing before at $10, we've been static, okay, so what we're going to do now is clear that out, it's going to hit play on the depth of market and show you the same two transactions on a depth of market, so I've just hit play on the depth of market, and you can see it's moving around, and if you just saw that, guys, the first thing I did there was just clear, now you'll be able to do this, you can do this any time of day if you like, where you're just clearing out the recent bid and ask volume, so it's just cleaning it out so I can almost make it equal to the example that we're seeing, a fresh market, so I'm just going to clear the middle market orders out for you, so that's what you're seeing there, let's get rid of that, and let's just play the action again, and what you've also may have noticed is, like I said on my platform, it doesn't show the half increments, but guys, believe me, it makes no difference, I've just drawn it in there so it's easier for you to see it, that it's 28, 28 and a half, and so on and so forth, so the market at the moment is what, bid 28, offer 28 and a half, the market in bananas is bid 10, offer 11, so let's just clear out the bids and offers which we have, so what have we got at the moment, the market's just opened, do you agree guys, 824 buyers have stepped in, 750 sellers have stepped in, okay, do you remember in the morning, what did we have, we had, I'm just going to use a line here, 4 buyers, 4 sellers, 4 on the bid at 10, right, and sorry about this, just get my pen ready, 4 on the offer at 11, guys, what difference is it, it's a banana market, it's a treasury market, euro dollar market, no difference, this time we've got 750 offers, now remember it could be several people, one person, but we're going to assume it's 750 sellers, just so I can get my point across, who are offering to sell, but it's 28 and a half, guys, it could be anything, euro dollar, you heard me saying whatever the price was earlier, around the 40 mark, 40, 40 and a half, here it's 28 and a half, who cares what it is, it's a price, and that price is the price that's being offered, right, by 750 people here, and these people are bidding 28, same as the banana market, it could be bananas, it could be anything, so now we're just going to play it, and I want you to watch what happens to these two columns that I've circled, okay, so it's just playing along, yeah, can you see how that's changing, guys, so here, what just happened there, was that about 800, what the exact number was, and it's gone down to about 650, right, so let's just back that up again, 816 down to, say, 630, right, so we'll say about 180 contracts, guys, can you see anything transacting here, nothing, and this was my point before, where I said, look, it doesn't matter how many people are supplying bananas on the offer side, or supplying bids on the bid side, it doesn't matter what the supply is, remember that, supply, supply, guys, no difference, supply, supply, and again, I apologise for the pace, I'm going very slowly, took me a while to get it, I'm going to assume that people will like me in it, it's going to take them a while to get it, if you get it already, fine, you know, you can crack on, but because this is what forms a volume profile and footprint, I'm going to take as long as necessary, as I think necessary, and don't forget, guys, if you're sitting in a professional firm, guys, you're going to be spending a month, two, three, four months doing this stuff, me taking a couple of hours of your time to explain this is really, what, minuscule in comparison, so just bear with me, and it will be helpful for you in the future, so you saw that reduce by 170, guys, nothing got transacted on the volume profile, right, as you saw before, we had four people here, four people here, didn't matter, that supply is changing, like I said, there could be a supermarket like Costco or Walmart that has a thousand, the chocolate bar example I used before, they may have a thousand chocolate bars on their shelf, guys, they may decide to come along and say, do you know what, let's put 10,000 on there, guys, if no one buys a thing, what difference does it make, who cares, makes no difference, so that's the supply side, right, so what's happening is buyers have decided to step off the gas a little bit, but this made no difference because no transactions have taken place, okay, so this is going to continue, I'll just show you how that, if you look there, 56,720, didn't change, okay, so drop to, now it's dropped to 600, you see that 56,720, guys, it stayed identical, it hasn't moved, okay, so let's just press play again, okay, do you see what happened there, guys, so let's back it up, do you see how that suddenly increased to 1,258 from 700, okay, so it was at 600, so went down to 600, okay, then 700, that's why I said 700, because, I mean, I've been watching this thing for so long, I spotted the 700 at the blink of an eye, and then it shot up to 1,200, okay, so 5,600 people came along and decided to say, oh, I'm ready to buy, guys, what's happened, nothing, so same thing here, as I said this morning, if, you know, if you're bidding 10 for a box of bananas, another 500 people come along, guys, if these guys don't want to sell to you at that price, it makes no difference, you know, 5,600 contracts have been added at 28, if these guys at 28 and a half don't want to do what, pay down, if you remember from before, guys, nothing is going to happen, so as I said, someone, would you agree, one of these sides is going to have to give in for the price to change, either, as we saw in the example, you paid up, right, to 11, or what happened afterwards was the seller paid down to 10, now, in this example, you're actually going to see, I can't remember, I believe a seller comes in first, but either way, we'll deal with it, whatever happens, but one of these guys, obviously, eventually, is going to capitulate, so the guy selling treasuries at 28 and a half is just going to give in and say, look, basically, I need to get rid of this thing, I'll hit the bid at 28, exactly the same way you saw with the bananas, or it may happen the other way, but I do believe it's the seller first, but let's see what happens, either way, one side eventually capitulates, so when I said to you before, guys, it's normal in a banana market, you're going to be stubborn, you're going to try and get the price you want, you can see it yourself, don't take my word for it, I've just shown it to you, in the financial markets, look, guys, these guys, they're playing around, they're posturing with each other, the buyers, they're trying to say, look, we've got a desire to buy, the sellers are saying, we don't care, they're also playing around with their offer side, but at the end of the day, who cares, because no one's actually placed a market order, so let's continue with the action, okay, so there you go, someone eventually caved in and said, okay, we'll do what, I'm going to sell three, right, so this is the market orders, okay, guys, this will get recorded in the footprint and in the volume profile, so this would have been 56,720 and it's just gone up three, so did you notice, guys, this went up and down by hundreds of contracts, the 600 went up, it went down, this went up to 1,200, 1,300, it came back down to 900, but guys, nothing changed, the only thing that mattered was someone decided to pay down, and I hope this is starting to make sense now, that's why I spent so long with it on the banana market, because there is absolutely no difference, guys, okay, people think I'm exaggerating when I tell them it's like the banana, they think it's similar, guys, it is identical, no difference, supply and demand, so we had supply on either side, but there was no demand to buy or sell, suddenly demand came in to sell three contracts, same way, did you see, the person stepped down and said, fine, you know what, I'll sell you my bananas for 10, this guy said, fine, I'll sell you my treasuries for 28, could be Eurodollar, someone has 600 contracts to offer and says, fine, do you know what, I'm going to sell them Eurodollar at 28, no difference, and I will show you on the Eurodollar market later, but as I said, that thing just flies so fast, you're going to be happy that I'm showing you this, because on that you will learn nothing initially, so let's continue the action, just quickly draw these back on, so it's easier for you, 29, 29 and a half, 27 and a half, 27, 26 and a half, 26, 30, 30 and a half, so now we're going to continue the action, now let's see what happens, do buyers step in, do sellers step in, again, you can see, guys, the bids and offers are changing, right, so let's just crank this back, bids and offers are changing, I'll show you the market sell order that came in, bang, three came in, but look, yeah, you see the 844 there, keep an eye on the bids and offers, guys, and even these are changing, this has gone up to 1500 and so on and so forth, but at the moment I'm only concerned with the best bid and the best offer, because I'm trying to keep it basic for you, so just notice how the market is changing, so I'm going to go back and I'm going to go back and I'm going to go back and I'm going to go back because I'm trying to keep it basic for you, so just notice how that's changing, 857, 813, 844, 927, 955, do you see, it doesn't matter, guys, the supply is changing, but nothing is changing in the volume profile and no market orders are being made, so the footprint isn't being updated, volume profile isn't changing, and let's continue the action, as I said, we're waiting to see which side gives in eventually, and there you saw it, so what happened, guys, it's like you, do you remember the example where I said your name's John and you were sitting there on the bid and eventually what happened, you got fed up of waiting, your boss called you and said, look, you need to buy that box of bananas, pay up, what happened, guys, one of these buyers, or 45, more accurately, was sitting on the bid, right, they were sitting there at 28, maybe they got a call from a boss, probably not, because it's a financial market and it moves so fast, it could have been an algorithm, anything, any reason, typically what's happening, guys, it's beyond the scope of this module, but I will tell you now that algorithms are watching these bids and offers, they'll be watching volume profile, they'll be watching not necessarily the footprint, but the information on the footprint, i.e. the market orders, and that's what they'll use as a basis to make a decision, whether to throw in the towel or not, but what did they do, they threw in the towel, eventually they got fed up of waiting for someone to do what, transact with them at 28, i.e. sell to them, so what did they do, they basically went and bought, why would they wait for someone to sell, because if someone sells to you, you get long, so they wanted to get long at 28, eventually they threw in the towel, said fine, I'll pay up 20 and a half, guys, I'm sorry to keep repeating this point, but it's so important, and I hope you see it in a positive light, keep saying it, not trying to patronise anyone, but like I said, I didn't get it at first, it took me ages to wrap my head around it, so hopefully this actually proves useful to you, the fact that I keep saying it, could be a box of bananas. $10 sitting on the bid, let's say this said 10, 45 people were sitting there, just like you, John was sitting there, got a call and said look, pay up, what did they do, they said fine, we'll pay up to 11, we'll pay up to 28 and a half, that was 10, then it's pay up to 11, 10 to 11, 45 people, okay, they bought from who, do you remember we took the supply out here, there was the seller, so these 45 placed market orders with the supply side, pending orders, resting orders, so they got taken out, the thing is, and this is where the example ends now with the depth of market, because you see, we've had the same two-sided transaction happen, selling and buying, aggressive selling and aggressive buying, wasn't as aggressive, but for the purposes of this example, we've at least shown that there's been selling and buying on both sides, so on my footprint guys, it will show, you've seen it, the candlestick with the footprint, it will show 3 and 45, these numbers, on the volume profile, this will go up plus 3 and this will go up by 45 plus 45, okay, so this would have said 38,262 minus 45, so I'll just show you that, okay, so 38,217, if you add 45 to it, feel free to do it on a calculator, you're going to see it goes up to 62, so just fast forwarding this slowly, there you go, you see that, 62, 17, 45 pops in, 62, so can you see guys, the supply side is not moving the volume profile, it's the market orders, it's demand, 45 were demanded, yes, people got short and people got long, but all we care about is the people that actually did what, sat there and were happy to move their price up, because what does that tell me, that tells me that this market is getting aggressive, and this is the beauty of the footprint and volume profile, is I can see in terms of transactions happening, they're building at higher prices and the footprint is telling me 45 people got aggressive versus 3 people getting aggressive on the sell side, so 45 people got aggressive on the buy side versus 3 on the sell side, here it was one or, you know, whatever it is, obviously we'll be able to see that on the footprint in terms of the market orders, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to stop this, we're going to go back to the footprint, sorry, to the banana market, and we're going to continue the banana market and then we'll come back to the depth of market, but one final point to note, again, just for completion sake, because I mentioned it a few times here was, did you notice guys, these two transactions have taken place, yeah, we've seen actual market transactions taking place, guys, what's happened to the price, nothing, it's identical, okay, do you remember when one was bought, one was sold, guys, the price didn't change, why was that, because I said to you guys there's still supply of bananas on the sell side, there's still a supply of bananas on the buy side, what's happened here, 45 contracts have been bought aggressively by the buy side, the blue army have pushed up, as I said in the first part of this module, but have they been able to infiltrate the defences of the red army, i.e. the sellers, no, because there's still supply, guys, they haven't cleared out the supply, so only when they clear this supply out, eat into the sell orders, market orders, will the price tick up, we're going to show you that, and that's the point, I'm going to come back, show you that happening in the banana market, and show you how things get interesting, and I'm going to show you that in the depth of market example, so I'll just clear this, and we'll come back to the banana market now, okay guys, so we're back to the banana market now, and let's just remind ourselves of what's going on, we've still got supply at the bid, and we've got supply in the offers, so there's still supply at both prices, right, supply, supply, market orders, which is demand, I'm sorry to repeat myself, but I'm just going to keep saying it again, and again, and again, until everyone gets it, trying to treat everyone equally, and just assume that, you know, there's going to be people that don't get it, like I didn't, so I'm just going to keep saying it again, and again, and again, but we've got two and two, so pretty even market, now let's assume that more time goes on, okay, and these guys start, there's two possibilities, okay, these guys look at their watch and think, oh the day's cracking on now, I've got customer orders, I've waited long enough, and, you know, there's a danger that the market shuts and I don't get filled, so they decide to buy, both these guys need to get filled, so they decide to buy, and they clear this out, there's another alternative, right, but we don't know, because we can't get inside the head of people, we can obviously make an educated guess, and believe me, algorithms, hedge funds, institutions are doing this all day long, looking at supply and demand, guys, not indicators, they're looking at this, the depth of market, or volume tools, they'll be looking at to try and get clued in as to any tiny shifts in supply and demand, these guys might have some information that leads them to believe that if they purchased these bananas at 11, then they may be able to sell them on for a profit, right, we don't know, the fact is that after some time, these guys decide, right, we need to make our move now, so they pay up to 11, the big difference this time, guys, is when the previous purchases were made, they were still supply, look what they've done, they've just wiped it all out, and they've actually been willing to pay up, so here's a crucial thing, again, can you see, this is absolutely crucial information to me, because I'm looking at this thinking, hang on, there's two guys out there, they were bidding at 10, but they've been willing to pay 11, that's demand, that tells me there's demand in the market for bananas, I can see that aggression is coming in, so clearly that's information to me, so what happens, as we said before anyway, is as we saw before, even though there's movements in supply, doesn't get recorded until a market order occurs, someone pays up or pays down, so in this instance, the bidders paid up, so what's going to happen to this one, it's going to change into a three, it's a cumulative number, one plus the two buyers is three, we're also going to see two clearly get transacted here, okay, and then obviously this is going to get cleared out, guys, now again, the key is this time they've cleared this out, so the price is going to move, guys, and I haven't said it at all, it's the first time I'm coming to it, because I don't want to overwhelm anyone, but guys, there you have it, this is what actually causes the price to move on your chart, it is supply being cleared out by demand, which kind of makes sense if you think about any market, once you clear out supply of one price, you move on to the next, it's as simple as that, and like I said, it's happening in the banana market, and I'm going to show you that it's happening in every single financial market in the same way, so let's just move this along, okay, so this one is going to shift to a three, this is going to get cleared out, and the volume profile is going to build, so there you go, you can see that jumped to three on the volume profile, that's now turned into a three, and these guys are going to get cleared out, which, so I'll just back it up and show you that again, okay, one turned to a three, volume profile, market orders, these two guys transacted, demanded from the suppliers two extra boxes of bananas, so it got recorded as market orders, and now also, these guys are going to get cleared out, okay, there you go, now this is where, guys, things get really interesting, because, again, we don't know the exact reasons for this, but these two guys, can you see they're still in the market, before, what did we have, when you bought your box of bananas earlier, at 11, because you were willing to pay up early in the morning, do you remember, you disappeared for the day, and the seller disappeared for the day, here, fine, supply's been cleared out, but look, these guys are still sticking around, we don't know why this is, this could be, you know, a reasonable explanation could be that, yep, they've got those client orders that they need filling before the day's out, and obviously they're worried that they'll miss out, and the market will shut, but also, it could be that, so, coming back to that reason, that they have more than two they need to buy, right, perfectly reasonable that they need to fulfil more than two client orders for bananas, it could be that they need four, five, six, we don't know, but the fact is they're still there, and they're hungry to purchase more, okay, now, basically, can you see the gap between the bid and the offer, it's now two, why is that, because that's another thing that occurred, when these guys moved up, here, look what happened to the offer guys, it went from 11 to 12, boom, it shifted up, okay, why is that, because there's no more supply at 11, the offer price has now gone to 12, these guys are now going to have to pay 12, right, they'll have to pay up to 12, they're not too keen to obviously pay up two prices, but they're also cognisant of the fact that, you know, we're in an aggressive market, look guys, we've had three aggressive purchases, and only one aggressive sale, so three pieces of demand versus one, what's the ratio, three to one, on the footprint, you'll see this ratio talked about all the time, an imbalance of three, but that is when people in institutional circles talk about imbalances, that's what they're talking about, market orders guys, demand, demand of buys exceeded demand of sales by three to one, so yeah, the market is aggressive right now, it's starting to build up a little bit of steam in terms of the price wanting to go up, right, so again, what they think to themselves is, look, we don't necessarily want to go up too, but if we stay here in an aggressive market, what's the chances, guys, of these sellers coming down, would you agree, it's very unlikely, if you were holding a box of bananas, and you were sitting there, that's you on the offer side, you had them at $12, you're looking below you in terms of price, depth of market, and you see all this aggression coming in, you've just seen people willing to buy at $11, wow, and only one, what, you're going to stand your ground, aren't you, so what these guys do is, they say, fine, all right, we accept it, we're not going to get, we're unlikely to get the extra orders we need of bananas at $10, let's move up one, so what these guys will do is, they're going to move up there, okay, what's also going to happen, guys, what you've got to realise is, as I said, these sellers can see this on the depth of market, all these sellers, suppliers, they can see this, guys, this $1177 can see that $45, these $1126 can see $45 I've just transacted, you're going to back off, aren't you, if aggression is coming towards you, you're not going to move towards it, obviously, you're going to stand your ground, or move back, or back up, so that's exactly what is happening, guys, these guys can see it, they're very unlikely to come down, which is why the bidders go up, and secondly, guys, these guys are also watching, just like this side, this $1604 buyers can see that the market's getting aggressive, guys, they want in on the action as well, they're not just going to sit here at $9 sitting, you know, $2, $3 away from where the price is, the best offer is, so what they'll also do is they're also going to move right up, so what you're going to see is you're going to see aggression coming on the buy side as a result of aggression building on the demand side, I'm going to show you this in the depth of market, but let's just fast forward this so we can just reflect that on here, okay, so we're going to move all the buyers up, because obviously they've seen the aggression, and for the reasons that I described, okay, so those two move up, and look, bunch of guys now are going to join them, see that, and then everyone else, look at the gap, guys, you know, you're not going to sit there at $8, if you really want to get along with this market, you're going to move up as well, so they move up, new buyers come in, and guys, can you see how momentum starts to build in all financial markets, look what's happening, guys, we called it the blue army, but it's buyers, buyers are suddenly starting to come in, and look what's happening to sellers, look at the difference, guys, buyers are now, look out of nowhere, it's suddenly momentum has shifted, prices moved up, and I say that, I'm going to go to the depth of market now, I'm going to hit play, and I'm going to show you this happening in the depth of market, but just in terms of institutional speak and your chart, because earlier we talked about the chart flatlining at a bit of $10, right, this is one of the most critical moments of the entire institutional course, why is that, well, let's just back this up a moment, guys, and I'll just clean that, clean that out, one critical thing has happened, and that is that price has moved up, before when buys and sells were happening, price wasn't moving, now, the supply has cleared out at $11, right, it's all cleared out, and look what's happened to the price, the bid, that was at $10, offer was at $11, offer's moved up to $12, look what happens to the bid, guys, as I move this, goes up to $11, right, so we were at $10, bid's gone up to $11 now, bid's gone up to $11 now, as those guys all move up, guys, this is called a tick up in institutions, and you may have heard the term before, but there's another word for it, it's called, we'll say, if I'm on the institutional trading desk, I might be talking to my colleague, I'll say, oh, the market's gone bid, so what that means is that the market has, the bid has moved up, the bid, the buyers, have caused the price to go up, you can go off it as well when it's the other side, but the institutional speak, if you're on a desk, many, many times, obviously, I would have used this terminology, I may have said it to my boss, that, oh, the market's bid, keep an eye on it, that's what I mean, is the bid has shifted from 10 to 11, guys, it's bid, you know, on eBay, if you're buying a product and the price is going up, you can say it's well bid, so, you know, it's a pretty commonly used term, but that's what it means in any wholesale market, the banana market's just gone bid, I'm going to show you the treasury market going bid, and at some stage throughout the course, I'll obviously show you the pound dollar, euro dollar, S&P 500, whatever market will go bid, guys, the market went from 10 bid to 11 bid, 12 offer, before it was at 10 bid, so can you see, guys, now, I don't know how long that was, but let's just assume it was three, four hours in, we said this was an hour before, apologies, got the wrong gradient there of pen, so we said that the market was stuck at 10, and I kept saying, look, the supply needs to be cleared at 11 before we can move up, those guys got aggressive, cleared out the bananas that were on sale at 11, and what happened to the bid? Ticked up. Okay, guys, why say this in the most critical moment in the course, because now you're seeing, guys, it's no indicator that's caused this to tick up, it is buyers demand clearing supply, that's what causes this to tick up, and again, one of the major reasons why in professional trading environments, you know, the most profitable algorithms in the world are using the depth of market, they're programmed to read the depth, demand and supply, I say depth, depth of supply, but you know, they're using demand, they're using supply, I prefer the demand side, but obviously everyone is slightly different, so now what we're going to do is we're going to press play, and I'm going to show you this exact scenario, play out on the depth of market, and then again, we'll come back to the banana market, okay, guys? So just going to back this up, guys, so obviously we know it's at 3.45, I'm just going to show you some offers being cleared out, and how the financial market actually ticks up, all right, so let's back this up again, right, so we had three contracts hit the bid at 28, right, and we're just waiting for offers to be lifted, there you go, so 45 got hit on the offer side, or lifted, as we like to say in institutional speak, now would you agree, guys, there's 215 contracts left that need to be lifted, in the same way those two guys were still here, that needed to be cleared out, can you see these 215, they still need to be cleared out, now we're going to see, literally as I've hit play, obviously people can see the aggression coming in the buyers, some of these buyers, like those two buyers in the banana market that, you know, just decided they'd had enough of waiting, you're going to see these buyers, 1098, some of these have enough, and they just literally wipe out the supply as soon as I hit play, there you go, okay, so what's happened is the market has now ticked up, so let's back that up, okay, do you see that, so it went from three, so we went from 28, 20 and a half, and we ticked up, guys, we went bid up, we went from 28 bid, 28 and a half offer to 28 and a half bid, 29 offer, let's have a look at that again, okay, so 45 get lifted, look, we're at 28, 20 and a half, the bids, they're all going to move up, guys, as we saw in the other example in the banana market, see that, 422 move up, okay, keep rewinding it if you have to, but immediately the bids move up one level, the same way, guys, that you saw the bidders moving up, here, then slowly the bid started filling in, what you're seeing here is the bids have moved up, okay, and then we're going to come back to it anyway, but the point is the bids have moved up, and you can see they're starting to fill out actually quite nicely, look at this, 1,600, 1,200, okay, guys, some of these offers have backed off a little bit, they can sense the aggression coming in, and this pattern is going to continue, but first let's go back to banana market, then we're going to come back here, just wanted to show you that it's exactly the same here, and in fact what I'll do is, so you've seen the market tick up, guys, and you saw, let's just remind ourselves how long it took for the market to tick up in treasuries, right, sitting, waiting, nothing's happening, nothing's happening, supply's changing, no one's lifting, no demand is coming, there's a lot of supply changing, but no market transactions, and we're going to see three come in, hit the bid, and we're going to see some offers lifted, 45, and then they're all going to get taken out, aren't they, so let's just give it a second, boom, there you go, boom, so there, did you see how long it took, guys, for that to happen, now, got a little treat for you guys, this is where you're going to thank me, just get rid of all this, right, why I'm not using the, and I've got to laugh, why I'm not using the euro dollar or pound dollar market, because let me show you, okay, this is euro dollar, guys, exactly the same thing, and you're starting to get used to it now, okay, now look what happens, look how fast, guys, do you see that, guys, we just moved, what, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 prices in the blink of an eye got taken out, okay, 7, 8, 9, all these prices look like they're moving up and down like a yo-yo, now, to me, I can read that, because I've been watching this for years and years and years, but guys, never seen that before, how am I supposed to teach you on something like that, it's impossible, right, look what I did here, I cleared it, where was the clearance, there, and look how quickly, literally within, what, within 1 or 2 seconds of me clearing it, it just started moving again, can you see it, guys, look how many prices were just eating through supply, demand is just eating through supply, just like that, and that's the one I was actually looking for, I thought I saw it a second ago, but I'm too good at using this thing, can you see it, there, I clear out and look how quickly they come back, clear, boom, straight away, levels being taken out, guys, I'm not going to be able to teach you on that, am I, eventually, if you watch it long enough, then you'll be able to pick that up what's going on pretty quickly, but as I said, I don't really watch the depth of market too much these days, I prefer the demand side of things, but when we come to do the review, I'm going to obviously ask you guys, look, please go and watch this thing for, give it 2 or 3 weeks and believe me, you'll pay dividends for the rest of your trading career, but for now we're going to go back to the banana market and pick things up, guys.

Okay traders, so this section is where we start to get really hands-on now and as I said in the introduction to this, this is going to be all about placing orders because I really think this is the best way that we're going to reinforce all the theoretical concepts that you've learnt up until now, so really understanding the difference between demand and supply, understanding the difference between market orders and limit orders or passive orders and being aggressive or being passive. What's the difference between those? Those are crucial elements because when you're aggressive that's what you're seeing on the volume profile and footprint, when you're passive you have an impact but it's more subtle and just like learning to drive a car from reading a book, really the main concepts and education and 90% of the learning comes from the practice, so what I really want you to do now for the next at least good couple of weeks if not longer is start to place some trades, absolutely crucial you understand this, you're not placing trades to make money, you're placing trades to understand the difference between, so I've abbreviated it here, between demand and supply and aggression and passive intent, that is the sole aim, so you've succeeded if by placing orders you've understood the differences, you've understood when market orders appear here, why they're appearing here, what exactly these columns are and why they're supply, why these are demand and why this is what you see appearing on the volume profile and on the footprint, so if that's the aim, so what I've done here is I've got a little example here, it's pound dollar, I don't want you to use pound dollar, I want you to use the treasury market, so I've done a little video here on the simulator using the exact same free trial on Sierra chart that you're using, you can see I've updated it so you've now got the exact half tick increments that I didn't have in the banana market example, but as you can see it doesn't really make much difference but it's nice for you to have that and you should have that when you've got your free trial, it should all be updated, like I said I've spoken to Sierra chart, they fixed a small technical issue there that they were having, so before I click play I just want to go over what we're seeing on the depth of market and then what I want you to do is, if I just clear that, what I want you to do is I want you to keep referring back here whilst it's playing here and also when you're doing this for yourself so you can remind yourself, so essentially there's four key elements you need to understand as we go through the video and then subsequently as you're doing it for yourself in real life, I want you to write these things down, maybe not now but as you're doing them, have a, you know I think what I noticed is when I was in a professional trading environment and the reality is traders, I don't want to mislead you, it's not the case that when you're in a professional trading environment every person makes it through, in fact the success rate was very low, now if I look back to what were the nuances that allowed me to succeed and I noticed other people weren't doing, and you're going to laugh when I say this, a lot of it was just literally guys I was using a pen and paper all the time I was writing things down, if I saw things on the bid or the offers for example on the depth of market that I thought were unusual, I'd be writing them down, I'd be writing down the prices, so I don't necessarily want you to do that at this stage because we'll do that as we advance and I'm going to do some videos about all of that later when you should be doing that, for now my point is have a pen and paper on you all the time and just jot things down in these categories, so I want you to understand like I said four main things, so let's just make a note of those as we go through it on this depth of market using pound dollar and then we're going to do it in real time using the video which I've pre-recorded and we're going to go through that with a real life example then you're going to do it yourself, so number one is market order, so market order, so what is, I'm going to split this out into buys and sells okay, so this is the buy and sell okay, so market order, market order, pending order, pending order okay, so as I've said many times throughout the course so far market orders have different connotations to them and different meanings to them that all mean the same thing, so what do I mean by that, well market orders mean aggression okay and it's the demand side and that's what we see on the footprint and volume profile and it's the same on the sell side, market orders mean aggression, mean demand and mean that they're going to appear on the footprint and volume profile and I think where people get confused is they think of demand as only buying, if there's demand for chocolate bars it means what, there's demand to buy them, you see this is something you're just going to have to wrap your head around and it will become easier as you place orders on the depth of market yourself, guys you've got to understand that in financial markets and in the banana market and in many wholesale markets around the world, in fact every market there's demand to sell okay, there needs to be and you say well hang on that doesn't make sense to me but actually it does because if you think about it there's a supply of buyers, we've been through this in the banana market example, this is where we're going to turn it into practice but what does it mean on the depth of market, well guys it's this column, so essentially this is any time you want to buy and you're going to see this in a moment okay, you're going to use this column, you're going to take your mouse and you're either going to click in this blank space or you're going to click in this area, so you've got two options, whenever you want to sell you're going to be using this column right, the red column offers column and buying is the bids column, so it's the same thing guys, you've got two options if you want to sell, you can either click with your mouse on this blank space or you can click in this area, that is the only difference between market orders, aggression and being passive, it's hitting on the offer or using limit orders, you're doing this all the time in your retail platform you probably just don't realize it that when you leave a pending order or a limit order in the market you're providing supply to the market, when you hit buy or sell immediately you're providing demand to the market, so let's have a look at what that means and then we're going to immediately move on, so let's go for option, let's go through option one first right, so how do we place a buy market order which equals aggression demand, how do we actually transact volume that is demand, well look what we're doing, if I click here seek market order aggression demand, what am I actually doing, what am I telling the dome that I want to do, okay so you see here there's 27 sellers guys, I want to buy okay, I need people to buy from, so is there any sellers, where's the next price that sellers are willing to sell immediately, okay it's 128.74, so if I want to buy pound dollar right now and I mean right now this instant and I don't want to wait, do you agree I got hit buy and sell okay, so that's what in essence pressing the clicking the mouse on this spot is I'm telling these 27 guys I want to buy from you, now the quantity can be changed but typically because you're doing this so fast you will pre-decide what your quantity is, so because it's set at six as soon as I click here those 27 I'm buying six, do you remember same thing in the banana market, those people decided to do what, there were buyers here they decided to step up, they got aggressive, so if I buy six then you'll see six appear here, that goes on the volume profile and it also goes on the footprint okay, the point is as I said before these people are selling it right, don't forget there's sellers here but they're selling doesn't appear anywhere here because why, because they were passive, so what do I mean by passive, well as I said there's a second option if you want to buy right, passive orders, pending orders which you do all the time as well on your retail platform if you leave a limit, so the other option and I can use any of these squares, I just click on depending on the price right, when you place a pending order do not decide what price you want to buy or sell at, so let's say for example I wanted to buy, I didn't want to buy immediately at 128.74 which was the best available price if I want to buy right now, I thought well actually I want the market to retrace a little bit, so what you do is you click this area, that 59 will add six, what that means is do you see how you've added supply to the market, 59 plus six is what 65, so that will change to 65, you've now become a supplier, can you see that, you're sitting on the bid guys, you're waiting for these sellers to get aggressive, you're waiting for someone else as it comes down here to click into you, do you see how when you're an aggressive buyer you're clicking into these 27, it can be a little bit confusing because you don't actually click on the 27, you click on the blue blank square, but equally it's the same thing when we come here, the selling market order is aggressive, you just click on the blank square which means these 10 people, that could be you, you could be a supplier, i.e. you're willing to supply purchases to the market for people who want to sell immediately, now if someone decides, he comes along and says right I want to sell the market right now, you're doing it all the time in your retail platform so it should be nothing new to you and you decide all right I'm happy with the price 128.73, what do you do, you sell don't you, you hit the bid, you press the bid, well what that means is look can you see bid, you're pressing the bid when you're on your retail platform, it's the same thing, you're clicking this square here and you're buying from these 10 bidders, so obviously that will reduce by six right, go down to four and what you'll actually see is you'll see the six print here, because you got aggressive, you placed a market order guys, you didn't sit back in one of these columns, you actually went to the front right, you're at the front of the red army as I've said before, you're right at the front, you've gone into battle and you've said you know what I'm not going to sit behind everyone, I'm going to be aggressive, I'm going to sell right now, that's demand guys, on the sell side okay, so that's what's happening and that will appear here and that will go in the footprint and volume profile, absolutely crucial you understand this because we're going to, as you know in the pro course, we're going to go into footprint volume profile and I'm not going to cover the depth of market too much in that section, so it's really important you understand that it's only people that are being aggressive and buying or selling immediately, which doesn't mean that it's only buyers, of course if you sell here these 10 people or six, whatever the quantity amounts have bought from you, the only difference again is that they were passive, they waited for you to basically hit them, as I've talked about extensively in the banana market example, exactly the same, so that's what I want you to be doing, now we're going to come over here, we're going to play the example and I want you again, what you should be doing is as you go through, like I said get a pen, a piece of paper and pen and just write down in these four sections what you're doing every single time until you master it, it might take you a week or two if you're new to it, but guys understand that this one and three are essentially the two types of transactions that I focus about 99% of my trading on, the demand side, I keep saying it and I cannot stress it enough, it's the demand side, it's the aggression, it's the volume profile and footprint, okay, we're not interested, you can and like I said it's 1%, it's very rare that I'll be focusing on the supply side so much, the reasons for that is guys as you experience this yourself, what you'll notice is generally there's always supply in the market, whereas demand isn't always there, that's why for me demand is much more important, secondly demand is what, it's telling you a key piece of information, that a buyer or seller decided to get aggressive, you know it's all well and good having supply in the market, it's all well and good having buyers on the bids and sellers on the offer, but does it really mean anything in the grand scheme of things, yes it does, it can mean that there's some intent, it's passive intent, but the problem is, as I'll show you in the next section where I said I want you to see supply side games, we don't really know how much of it is real, how much of it is fake and so on and so forth, so for me it's all about one and three and then two and four, when you get much more skilled in a year, two years down the line, you can start you know keeping an eye on that, because at the end of the day, let's say you've got one or two screens and again it doesn't matter you can do this with one screen, it's not a problem, but the point is let's say you're looking at a volume profile, you're looking at a VWAP, you're looking at some fundamentals, you're looking at different time frame periods of charts, you're looking at so many different things guys and then on top of that you're looking at say the demand side of the market, can you see, adding the supply side on top of that, all the profile stuff, it's going to become too much information, you're going to have analysis paralysis, so that's why I say introduce things slowly, maybe much further down the line, you can keep an eye on supply and if it gets to the case where you've got eight out of ten factors and you just need a slight extra bit of piece of information, fine, do I really think it's going to be the difference between you being profitable and not? I don't think so, because like I said generally it's our goals guys that are running the supply side of the market, leave it to them, let's focus on what we're good at which is discretion and making analytical decisions on demand, so let's go over to the video and apologies for talking so much over that but I cannot stress how important it is and that's why I keep saying it over and over again and hopefully when you do real life examples yourself it's going to become abundantly clear, if not obviously you know you can ask questions and we'll do some group stuff as well but let's crack on now guys, I'm just going to press play on the video. Okay traders, so what you may have noticed is that I've changed this media player I'm using because it's going to allow me to zoom in but more importantly before I just hit play is I've done a whole section and I should have mentioned this at the start I completely forgot, really important guys don't think I've just left you to install the depth of market on your own I've done a comprehensive section I believe it's module five where I've done sierra chart installation okay so step by step I take you through the whole process of how to get the custom depth of market I've given you a template guys just go on google you'll see this depth of market you're looking to pay a thousand dollars plus easy money for something like this I've given it to you absolutely free I've put a template in section module five I've even showed you how to go through sierra chart installation and what to look for making sure you get your data set up so make sure guys you do this first before you attempt any of this because I don't want you trying to install all this stuff yourself okay so let me just wipe this clear sorry about that just remembered it as I press pause on the recording okay so I'm going to press play here so I think I hope I have anyway I've recorded it in the same order as one two three four over here and also what I've done at first is so I'm telling you this because I'm going to have to pause it otherwise anyway is when you first go to buy or sell you're going to notice on sierra chart is a warning will come up and the reason they do that is because guys one contract in the futures market is twelve dollars fifty per tick you know you could be placing six twelve fifteen hundred contracts guys a lot of money so a warning will come up every time you click buy or sell to place a market order a pending order a warning will come up say are you sure you want to place this that's at first obviously when you're new to it so you can leave it on or off personally I'll just switch it off because you're on simulator anyway so I'm going to show you how to switch it off personally I don't use it obviously I've been doing this for years so I've you know been years since I even had that warning on but I just noticed it so as I press play okay so this is you turn on your depth of market it's working look go to press buy for example on the buy column there you go I'm gonna click that do you see that notice comes up so I'm going to zoom into this okay what does it say guys comes up with whatever you wanted to do which was a buy limit order right because we didn't press on the blank space remember we pressed I pressed on the limit bid so passive and it says here basically confirm order are you sure you want to do this yes or no and then it says look guys confirmations can be disabled through the menu button on the trade window so I'm going to show you how to disable this because otherwise it's going to drive you bananas every time you're hitting buy and sell this is going to come up the market's going to move by the time you press yes or no the market's going to go without you so really it's not practical anyway in the long run to have this on so let me just show you how um that gets turned off which again I'll just continue pressing play okay so I'm gonna press no here to come out of this so I'm not going to place the buy order and then I'm going to show you guys how it's so you go to trade okay and you go to open trade window for chart okay so let's just double check that can you see it's that option there guys trade and then open trade window for chart okay so you click that okay then you get your trade window you see this then you click on m there now I've just taken it to the side so you can actually see the window that pops out when you press m so I'll bring it back in there's the m the little m confirmation and you need to click that confirm new orders that's it now every time you hit buy and sell guys it's just going to do it automatically so let's just back that up okay so you click on m confirmations and then you basically by ticking confirm new orders you're unticking it so it won't ask you to confirm new orders in the future okay so let's remind ourselves so what I'm going to do now and in fact I've done it I haven't done it in the exact order I've just realized I haven't done a market order first I've done but I've done the buy side first so I've done the passive order first the pending order now remember guys what do we do we click two options you either click in the blank section right you've seen it here for market orders or you sit on the bids so you can either buy in treasuries immediately from these 198 people or you can say you know what I'm not buying it right now I'm waiting for you to come to me I'm going to be on the passive side okay so then you can click in anywhere here you can actually there's actually bids here there's a setting where I've only done it to show the next 10 but theory guys there's bids all the way down you know people are placing bids all the time obviously they might want to get filled later on and you get big institutions who are obviously not bothered about one or two ticks and they'll leave orders in the market but we're not too concerned about that because that's much more longer term trading this is obviously intraday intraweek trading that we're more concerned about so I've switched off all of those so what we're going to do now is we'll place a pending order how do you do that well you click in this section guys so let's see what happens when I do that there you go did you see that I clicked on 136.17 so what happens is this green bit comes up and you'll see there's no number so I've set the order amount to six so sorry to back this up I'll just show you how you can change that there's two ways there's so you see your trade window can you see these numbers here so this is how you change your quantity how many contracts do you want to buy it's these buttons here guys okay you can press one two three four five six as default if you want more or less there you can place a hundred place 600 you place as many as you want obviously whether the market will be able to absorb that or not is another question but or you get front-runned but see front-running those type of games that I talked about those are the sort of things I used to watch for the the games but we're not going to go over that here because it's irrelevant but thought I'd just mention it because I said the word front-running so let's just get rid of that so that's how you can change your quantities by default there is another way of doing it when you're actually in the trade but the thing is guys you don't want to be messing around when you're actually in the trade because things are moving very fast so let's just go back to placing the bid okay so we're going to place the bid there did you see that at 136.17 I clicked on the blue square and you see what happened there when you click so you've got two options essentially now apologies I'm taking this slowly but obviously everyone's going to go if you're like me it took me ages to figure this out so I'm assuming everyone's going to be wanting me to go through this step by step look guys so I clicked on this area 312 what that means is I'm telling the market I want to place six contract pending order I want to be on the passive side okay so this is never going to appear in the volume profile footprint only the people that come and sell to me eventually if the market comes down and someone aggressively clicks on their blank square they're going to do what sell to me that six is going to be a six as a market order demand and that six will be added in volume profile and on the footprint but for now all you need to be concerned with is that you are on the passive side as a buyer you don't want to buy immediately because you didn't click there you put one of these limit orders in passive supply so it's shown up here right as a green highlight what that means is that you're on the bid and it's a pending order if it was live it would actually say plus six and you'll see that in a second now what you can do is guys you've got two options here you can cancel your bid by pressing the x which I'm going to do in a second or you can change the amount by pressing this little tiny rectangle square so let's see that do you see that I clicked it and it came up with this little box so I can change the amount it tells me the price I can change that which I'm not going to do so I'm just going to come out of this okay and then did you see I clicked the cross I clicked that little x and it cancelled it so you can cancel your orders do you see why the supply side is yeah okay it's a factor but why I look at it one or three years down the line it's not a factor that I look end of the day obviously you're going to be practicing the the depth of market for the next eight weeks yes look at it but I'm just saying I don't necessarily use it as a primary factor in my trading because machines are doing this all the time guys they're placing bids they're placing offers they're cancelling them they're cancelling them a lot of the times it's spoofing it's manipulation it's faking they're doing it because they want to create a false sense of supply they see a lot of the times what they'll do is they want people to think that there's support here and actually they're selling but they're leaving bids here as soon as the market approaches it they'll pull their bid boom the market collapses and they're actually on the sell side it's a game it's gameplay so that's very advanced and we're not really interested in that at this stage and like I said I don't really look at it anyway anymore so much so let's not worry about that too much but the point is you can cancel it and the reason I ever mention this because I want you to realize this is what they're doing all the time they're placing bids they're cancelling them placing bids they're cancelling them and you're going to see that in the next module where we do supply side games so that's pending orders buy side cancel so again pen and paper every time you do this I want you to write down oh I'm in category two I'm placing a passive order that's not going to go on the volume profile okay so what we're going to do now guys is we're actually going to place a pending order and try to get filled so I've cancelled that because clearly you know I'm trying to get filled at 17 the market's up at what 20 and a half 21 bid offer clearly not going to get filled anytime soon for the purposes of this example so I've cancelled that um let's clear this there you go so I've placed a bid now at 20 and a half right I'm trying to get filled doesn't happen see that market shot up so just notice what I actually need to get filled I'm going to move this bid now cancelled it at 20 and a half and I'm going to go right at 21 and a half so what do I need guys I'm one of these uh three or four hundred people sitting here on the bid right I need people to do what I need these sellers right these sellers aggressive sellers to place market orders and do what hit into my bid sell to me aggressively because I'm passively sitting there so I actually want to get filled and that's why when I initially tried to get filled a little bit lower do you notice people didn't take out the bid like I said in the banana market example there's buyers of bananas if people don't do you remember they could just sit there all day long and if no one actually aggressively sells to them they can be sitting there saying well I'm only willing to buy at this price the danger is you don't get filled so that's what you're seeing here and it's going to happen again I think so you can see there's a lot of buyers coming into the market I actually need sellers to get aggressive because I want them to do what I want them to clear out the bid i.e sell to me aggressively because I'm being passive right now so let's see what happens again I want you to do this yourself click on the button try and place a bid and see if you get filled or not think the market there you go the market went up do you see it never cleared out those 400 guys and now it's moved on this is the danger of being on the supply side and not being aggressive can you see why I'm so obsessive over market orders demand because which side is winning the battle right now buyers can you see the sellers are not being very aggressive and that's key information for me that will show up on the footprint that shows up on volume profile is the market orders on the buy side obviously on the volume profile you're not really too interested if it's a buy or sell it's more where you are relative to where the volume took place we'll go more into that in the advanced because I just want you to recognize that it's the aggressive side that's being recorded here and in the middle two columns right so demand guys remember demand is being recorded here when people are transacting here and we'll come back to that in a second let's just try and get filled as a supplier to the market for now so I'm gonna have to move this up again so let's see I can't remember exactly what I did here I think I tried to get filled there I'm not sure if I got filled at 22 you see the market I need it to do you see only four people sold into 22 guys and I'm trying to buy at 22 there isn't much interest in this market to sell so let's see what happens it continues to go up and I've missed it again I want you to do this I want you to you know place bids not get filled get filled this is why I say it takes a couple weeks at least to learn and understand what I'm doing here I want you to do the same things don't place market orders place pending orders write it down pending orders pending orders or place market orders I want you to see the difference can you see it's not being filled there's no plus six showing here or obviously in this instance I've got quantity of six but whatever the amount you decide that you're placing bids on so let's just continue try and get I think I finally get filled here right so at 23 one person has sold so far I need more people to sell to me to be aggressive see I'm being passive do you remember the banana market example I'm saying look I want to buy bananas but I'm not going to pay your price I'm not going to pay 23 and a half I'm only going to pay 23 if you come to me and that's what's happening right now there you go finally they sold now this is a little bit more advanced did you notice how we had two three hundred contracts on the bid here but only 51 got executed and that was enough to clear the bids and move the price down that's because some of those were fake again we'll come on to that later but what I just want you to recognize here is that you've finally been filled and that's why that's turned into a plus six okay so the point is that those six even though you bought it's the sellers guys that got recorded here how that 51 what you have to recognize is the six people that sold to you they've gone in this column your buy transaction is not recorded on the footprint or on the volume profile it's the seller's transaction why because if you notice what what did he do he placed the market order to match your pending order so let's just back this up do you remember how I said you've got to go into this blank column so what a seller did is he decided you know what I've had enough of waiting I want to sell at 23 so he actually transacted at the bid but one of your six that you had you've placed here so your passive he's got aggressive his six contracts got recorded as demand on the sell side this six will show in the footprint and the six would have been recorded here on the volume profile so that's demand okay so hopefully you're seeing the difference like I said keep practicing I just want to clear some of this mess away okay I'm going to actually exit this position at break even so I'm going to now become the aggressor why is that well I'm long guys of six so let's just get that back up there you go so I'm long of six I now want to become the aggressor because I've bought at six I now want to close it at break even for whatever reason that is maybe I don't think the market's going to continue to go up I've bought and I think well we're at the highs of the day the green line maybe I was a got emotional I was a bit too eager and actually I want to get out of it so I've got two options right I can place a pending order or I can be aggressive and sell so let's see what happens I'm going to be aggressive and I'm just going to get out of it because I want to get out of break even okay because you've got to remember guys if I place a pending order at one of these areas up here there's a risk isn't there the market doesn't go up and fill me it just continues to go down because sellers come in they get aggressive and they start wiping all the bids out suddenly I've got an order to close out that I take profit and I don't same thing happened in the banana market go back and remind yourself guys very simple it's happening in all the markets around the world anyway let's see I'm going to close it out by clicking here at 23 okay I'm going to place a market order now watch this plus six disappear see that it's gone I'm flat there you go you can see I'm just showing you here that I've made zero P&L I'm flat I've got no positions on flat you can see it says they're flat okay so let's just move that out of the way I'm just going to clear some of this mess up for you okay so next what do I do so let me just back this up because I did let it move forward I hope you can see what I did there place the market order so we've dealt with would you agree now we've dealt with so I just want to sorry about this I just want to clear this as well so we can tick them off as we go along so I've now shown you how to place and again you can do this once you've set up sierra chart as per the installation video we've dealt with that we've placed a pending order passive on the bid side and we've been part of the supply right so you should now understand what it means to be a supply side buyer to the market now what I want you to do is I want you to be an aggressive buyer I want you to be one of those people that show up on the volume profile sharp on the footprint and actually get to the front of the queue and aggression on the buy side so we're now going to deal with market orders so remember what I said guys you need to click this area so when we clicked here in this area you saw there wasn't a number it was just an order I wasn't actually filled it doesn't get transacted it's not demand right think about if you walk into mcdonald's and you say all right fries are costing $99 and you just sit there and say well actually I'll buy it I'll wait till it goes to $98 you might be waiting a year but that doesn't matter the point is you haven't actually made a transaction right mcdonald's haven't recorded $98 on their sales because it hasn't happened guys you might be sitting there saying I'll wait for the price that's all that happens when you're sitting here you're providing supply in terms of purchases you haven't actually been filled yet yes it's a very important element of course without supplying there would be no market but you know to sound like a broken record I'm going to keep saying it it's not as important as demand because we actually want to know the actual demand the actual transactions that have happened in the market so anyway so what we're going to do is we don't want to be a supplier we want to walk into mcdonald's and we want those fries right now we're just going to pay whatever price they're giving us so what's the price right now 23 and a half so I'm going to hit 23 and a half and you're going to see plus six because I'm going to get filled instantly so let's just see that okay boom there did you see that the same thing's going to happen you're going to go in your depth of mark I want you to do at this end of this video and press it and you'll see so now I'm long of six okay guys now we'll get out of this position I'm not I can't remember exactly how whether I placed a pending sell because I'm long or whether I just clicked out of it immediately so I think the purpose what I'm doing here is I'm trying to show you that you've got two options guys you can either get out straight away at a loss of one tick right it makes sense because bid offer so you pay the bid offer and you get out immediately at one tick loss right you've entered here and you get out which is I think what I just did so let's just back this up see can you see I've gone offside why is that because I've bought at 23 and a half and the best price I can get to sell at is what 23 so that's why it's gone red because I'm at a loss of one tick so I bought at 23 and a half I'm going to click that and you'll see this disappear there you go so that disappeared just clean this up so what I've done is I'm just I don't want to get too confused but it's the way the treasury market works is it works in 30 seconds so one over 32 is how it works so basically because I had three contracts and all of these if you look at them they move in halves sorry because I had six contracts right it's just actually basic maths it's increments of half is actually one tick so it's half of a 30 second so what's six times a half three guys so it's three 30 seconds is what I've just lost and that's what you're seeing can you see that there where it says three 30 seconds so that's all that is keep rewinding it if you don't get it but it's pretty straightforward that's the way it works like I said it's just basic maths but so that's minus 3 32 so let's move on so what have we done here we've now dealt with market orders on the buy side right okay so again when you're doing this I want you to write it down oh I just placed the market order write it down where does that go volume profile footprint where in this column see guys I want you to be making notes all the time like I said I'm not doing it to let you guys I know you're perfectly capable um you know I'm not particularly there's nothing special about me all I did in my early careers I just wrote everything down so I used to think to myself oh I click here where did that transaction go oh it shows in the demand column great I click here oh I'm in the supply column okay which side where eventually if I get filled is it going to show here yep it might show here or if I get if I obviously click this box it's going to show in this column demand column and it will show here I'll be making notes all the time and then I think oh okay so it's the sell transaction that's going to go in the footprint that's going to go in the volume profile in the pro course we will cover this in the footprint and I will show you the depth of market and how it fills the footprint but I just want to preempt a lot of this so it makes sense when I'm actually doing the footprint module that is market orders guys market orders demand that's filling volume profile and footprint it's the aggressive aggressor I beg your pardon so let's just let this play just clear this out okay so I believe I now move on to the sell side there you go so I've placed a sell pending order okay guys so let's just see that so now what am I dealing with so first I showed you how to buy as a passive buyer right then market orders now what I'm showing you is how do you sit on the offer it's called sitting on the offer why is that because it's an offer column and do you remember what I said to you all sales take place in the same column um which is the one to the right the offer column red army and uh sorry about this I'm just getting the right color pen so we've got two options right if we want to sell we can either place a market order we want to immediately we want to be the aggressor we want to demand sell a sell so we would be in this column if we did that or we can be part of the supply side right we've got two choices and we can hope to get filled so that's what I've done here can you see I clicked on this 288 area why is that well I wanted to join this queue of sellers but I'm not quite aggressive enough to say I want to get filled at 23 right now I'm thinking actually I want to sit and wait on this I'm going to be part of the selling army actually I'm not going to be right at the front I'm happy to sit passively and wait so that's what I do and that's why just notice guy there's no plus six it just shows up as a cell now I'm going to click this and you'll see that it's six and you can change that if you want but it's a default by six as uh I've already said so let's just let this play okay so you can see I've sold there I thought I clicked it but obviously I didn't remember this is pre-recorded okay so I just got filled did you notice that so what happened there's a passive order let's go through that very slowly what just happened guys what do I need to happen if I'm selling this passively I need what buyers to get aggressive so they come to me just like in the banana market I want buyers if I'm selling and I'm if I'm selling and I'm just sitting on an offer but I'm not selling immediately I need buyers to do what I need them to start hitting the offer I need them to start I need these buyers over here to place orders here don't I I need them to be ramping that up so they do what transact with me right so they're buying what they're doing they're buying from me I need them to transact with me I need them to buy from me because I want to sell so that's what happens look guys 65 they clear out this 362 okay now I'm kind of gonna go into the next section a little bit here just because it's a good opportunity did you see there was over 360 there and only 303 got filled so about 60 were fake guys 60 did what they cancelled I didn't cancel so that's why look I got filled it's now gone minus six okay I beg your pardon earlier I think I said plus six but it's a minus because it's short so it's the sign it doesn't mean you're in a loss it just means you're short six contracts okay now I'm going to close this trade out immediately I think again I'm not sure how I close it out whether it's a market order or not there you go so I did actually close that out immediately and there you can see no P&L did you see how I clicked that so I'm going to show you that again slowly I clicked 23.50 why because I'm short at 23.50 because I got filled passively I didn't pay the bid offer a little bit advanced but think about this guys I had two options right if I had got aggressive and sold at the price the market price at the time 23 I would have had to exit at one tick loss I would have had to pay the bid offer spread but because I was passive and I sat on the offer and I got hit at 23.50 it immediately gave me the offer this is one of the reasons a lot of people like to just sit on offers when they're speculating because if they're wrong they can get out of scratch they call it obviously the danger is you don't get filled as you saw before when we were placing bids trying to get filled to buy just kept moving away from us and obviously the equivalent could happen sellers could just keep hitting this and I don't get filled on myself but essentially what happened is I did get filled I got short of six and I clicked I got aggressive and I just took it out straight away right instead of placing a bid in the market I got aggressive I took it out so you're going to see that minus six disappear boom there you go it got disappeared and I bring that across and there you can see I made zero P&L okay so what have we dealt with now we've pretty much dealt with all of them we've just got a sell market order left I think so I'm just going to mark the passive order so you should be comfortable again do this yourself guys do it a thousand times I probably did this ten thousand times just to get my head around and wrote it down wrote it down wrote and just kept doing it until took breaks of course did maybe half an hour here half an hour there and so on and so forth you don't particularly need to do this at any time of day I'd suggest maybe do it at a quieter time of day which isn't when the US market is open because it gets very busy and it can be quite fast but maybe do it out of hours so you can do it slowly but we're just going to do one more which is the market sell order so do you see that I clicked in at 22.50 guys so rather than clicking say 300 or 512 by basically sitting on the offer and selling at any of these prices I've now decided just like in the banana market ah do you know what I'm just going to sell right now so I clicked this I sold from one of these 330 people that are buying wanted to buy passively so my transaction guys remember I said write this down whereas when I got filled here it's the guy that bought from me right his six got put here as a buy even though I got short his transaction got recorded here because I immediately got aggressive and stepped down my transaction will now get recorded in the demand column as six in this column right so that's the difference guys keep doing it until you you recognize that difference um so I'm just going to play this okay so you can see I've got live position now that's what that is minus six at 22.50 there you go 22.50 so I don't know if I think I tried to exit here on the bid okay so can you see the difference here guys before I was just exiting immediately so what would I do think to yourself maybe pause this video and see if you can get it if you want it if you were short and you wanted to exit immediately what would you do would you place a pending order or would you place a market order so pause the video think about it and think where you would click don't worry if you don't get it immediately because you're going to practice this yourself anyway okay so the answer is what it's a market order right on the buy side because you're short 22.50 if you want to exit immediately you need to do what you need to buy because you're short what's the best available price to buy at is 22 guys and if you want to buy right now and not passively i.e market order would you do you'd have to click there wouldn't you but what I'm showing you guys and this what a lot of guys are doing um that are trading depth of market or even trading um financial markets in general is they'll sit on the bid now because they want to get filled on the bid and when we go to the last video in the series and I'm doing an example where I'm showing you how I'm sim trading or I'm trading on the simulator and actually taking ticks out the market you'll see I sit on the bid I sit on the bid and it's very dynamic because what I'm doing is I'm sitting on the bid and I'm just trying to see what buyers and sellers are doing should I move my bid should I get aggressive and like I said it can very quickly start to get a little complicated because you're trying to bring all these factors together for now I'm slowly introducing you to this because I just want to show you that you don't have to exit immediately you can it's basically it's the same as a take profit guys right you're placing them in the retail market all the time except now you're seeing the depth what you don't see on your chart as a retailer is you might say oh I want my take profit at 20 so I want to make four five ticks or whatever the case may be you don't actually know how many are there I can see there's 375 there say for example this 398 suddenly shoots up to 500 and I've got my bid at 20 would you agree I'm going to move my bid up because I'm thinking the market needs to take 500 buys out first before they even get to me maybe I should move my bid up so put part that to the side but let me just show you that you don't necessarily need to click this area to exit you can place a bid and wait for the market to come towards you basically a take profit so that's what happens I think I tried to get filled on the bid again I pre-recorded this video so I can't remember if I did actually get filled and I did okay so you saw what happened there let's take it back and I made six ticks of profit so let's just see what happened you see 2150 what did I need I need needed sellers to get aggressive and take out my bid guys did they do that yes they did just notice 370 this is what I want you to notice I'm game playing 377 okay 396 I'm not too worried about small discrepancies but I want you to watch you know when I say there's fake orders on the on the depth of market is for example and this happens a lot when you see absorption and game playing going on is so the difference there was only what about 10 or 20 but imagine there was only 50 on the bid and or let's say there was a thousand on the bid and 396 got filled clearly there's a discrepancy so I want you to watch for that stuff in the future but there'll always be a discrepancy of 5 or 10 I'm not too bothered about that getting out of the way I got filled anyway at 21 and a half and that's why the minus 6 disappeared okay and that's my profit 6 over 32 okay so I'm just going to rewind this back again so I think just to end the video off I basically place a market order again and this time I get out right so what did I do there so I wanted I just realized well again I apologize just pre-recorded what I did there is I placed a market order on the sell side right pause this I placed the market order on the sell side and this time rather than getting out using a pending order I just got out aggressively so I could nicely round off the video for you so let's just look at that again okay so I'm going to hit the market get short straight away and that's where you're going to see the minus 6 appear sorry I did not rewind this back enough okay let's pick up the action here okay did you see that 21 and a half I clicked into the blank space guys so I sold market order write it down when you're doing this and I'm going to show you what I do is I think I exit at a one tick loss immediately see I didn't sit on the bid this time for my exit guys here I did what I exited immediately so I'm going to show you that okay so I took a loss of one tick and that's the end of the video guys so we've covered everything I want you to do the same thing I want you to place market orders on the buy side sell side getting filled immediately I want you to place pending orders on the buy side sell side getting filled passively ie supply market orders be the demand side on the exits I want you to do the same thing so I want you to place market orders or pending orders and practice exiting using market orders practice exiting using passive orders I want you to get used to knowing what it means to be the supply side and the demand side of the market it's going to give you an incredible understanding of why the market moves and what's going on it's supply and demand the interaction thereof is what's moving the charts guys you're not going to learn that by looking at a chart of technical analysis I hope you can see that so yeah good luck practicing that if you've got any questions let me know have fun guys see you on the next video

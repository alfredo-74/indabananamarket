Hello traders welcome to the next section static versus dynamic value absolutely huge milestone in your journey and in particular in the pro course. Why do I say that? Well you know we've been so busy looking at and delving so deep into individual items or pieces of the toolkit that you're going to need for example auction market theory we obviously looked at composite profiles which obviously took the shape of market profile we also looked at volume profile in depth on the depth of market and then on the chart we've obviously looked at depth of market itself in terms of bids offers market orders and so on and so forth and then we looked at the VWAP. So the reason I say it's a milestone is you've been so busy looking at all those things which let's be honest was absolutely necessary that you probably haven't realized you've essentially now got the entire toolkit that pretty much the best value traders in the world have and you've got a good understanding of that but that doesn't mean that obviously you're going to go out tomorrow and annihilate the market of course it doesn't in fact it is the first hurdle of many but can you see at least you're going in the right direction that's the point you're on the right path the path is incredibly long you know let's be honest it's going to take you a lot of screen time to actually bring all this stuff together although obviously I'm going to start doing that now bringing it together but point is that you know you've got everything that you need this is really stage one of bringing some of those tools together what I want you to do in this task is start to really develop a hypothesis for the day just based on what you've learned so far now what I like to do and look what I'm about to tell you it's not like Envy's mechanical system or something it's not you've got to get that thinking out of your head all I'm doing assuming that you did think that maybe you didn't but all I'm doing essentially by splitting out the value sort of approaches that we've looked at is I'm making it easier for me to develop hypothesis for the day and my point is I've never seen this before you know it being split out like the way that I'm going to tell you however I've seen it being used in this way before it's just never when I've looked at obviously I used to work around you know very successful traders in the past and they were using similar methodologies i.e. volume profile market profile VWAP of course it's widely used by institutions and I told you VWAP is pretty much standard across the board for all institutions so obviously I saw this being used and I kind of saw that traders were using obviously developing value with historical value you have to and I'm going to show you that but I just never saw it categorized in the way that I'm going to categorize it for you so you know I don't want you to think that's my point when I'm splitting it out like this I don't want you to think oh Envy's given us this amazing system no I'm what it is as I always said in this course my aim is to deliver to you the exact same training and tools that you would receive in a professional trading institution which I've done I've fulfilled that part but I'm trying to give you that extra bit more so don't think I'm leaving anything out and replacing it no I've given you exactly what you would get in an institution I believe I've explained it to you if I may say so ten times better than it would have ever been explained to you anyway on an individual basis you know market profile volume profile VWAP obviously depth of market and any other tools that I've shown you but I believe that's that's basically it in terms of the main order flow set that you'll be looking at obviously there's some stuff I know I've mentioned about footprint obviously and candles types that I talked about in module 6 but ultimately those are the core tools and you'll get that in a professional trading environment but obviously here my point is that I'm gonna categorize them in a way that I've never seen before so hopefully you see the value in that and but don't treat as a system all I'm doing is just putting them into categories okay I'm not combining them in any secret way that's gonna you know take over the world or no it's still going to be incredibly difficult for you to develop your understanding of this because it's going to take screen time but I believe by doing this it's going to accelerate that process and make it easier for you to see how value on an intra period basis works with value on a historical basis so I've said a lot why don't we actually go and look at this firstly just very briefly in the same way that we looked at during ultra market theory and then I'm going to show you on a chart so first there was an example and you'll have to forgive me because I can't remember the exact vaguely remember something about milk that I showed you guys where milk was in sort of a range right the price of milk was in this range and now it should make much more sense to you it's just a value area isn't it and the central sort of price which in market profile speak in a balanced profile exact balance the VWAP is going to equal the POC anyway obviously if there's a skew in the distribution that's going to change slightly but let's assume it's perfectly balanced and therefore you can call this the VWAP or the VPOC if you want or whatever it doesn't matter and then you've got your sort of 70% standard deviation right okay so this is the price of milk I believe we said it was 150 and then do you remember I said it's normally moving in a range of I think I said 140 again forgive me if I've got this wrong the principle is the same it doesn't matter all I'm doing is I'm just reminding you what we essentially looked at when we were in the market profile section and relating it to where fittingly where we started off with auction market theory very first so do you remember this milk price and then I said oh there was some disruption in the market I think maybe what was it cows fell ill or something and there was no confidence people were worried of it contracting the disease so then the price fell right and it started to and in fact let's draw it properly price fell and it started to establish fair value a little bit lower in this region and I believe it was about a dollar wasn't it again forgive me if I've got this wrong but in terms of prices principles are same guys can you see all you were doing when you were drawing composites right is basically this is what you were doing and I've gone over the logo but that's okay right do you remember and there's the edge of the price chart guys that is all you've been doing it's amazing right you couldn't apply this composite process doesn't have to be composites obviously that could be a single profile but my point is can you see now what you were doing at the end of the day doesn't matter if it's milk chocolates this that doesn't matter any item we've talked about it to death all you were doing is determining what the fair value was and you see that's all you were doing in milk and why was that because do you remember I said once this process happened here now either as I explained to you if you go back you'll if you forgot and you you go back where we did the value expectations framework and you are doing the composite work and I said if you break the value area low what's the expectation to go in balance can you see now that's obvious because we've done all that work in the VWAP section where I went into detail about balance and imbalance etc we kind of talked about this already during the composite stages where we obviously said if you break out of the value area low here you're going balanced right now you can see why that is even more if you hadn't already recognized it during the composite section we talked about this where the distribution shape changes and obviously you're going into you know different standard deviation areas and building value there you're going in balance essentially even if you forget the statistics I mean don't it is obviously slightly it's important but even if you just logically look we're in this range something's changed here hasn't it it's gone imbalanced and look we're doing this with the price of milk and then we went down and we established fair value around one pound and we may have built a couple of days of profiles here and then if you merge those two together you would essentially have composite wouldn't you so let me just push that back so you could have a couple of days for example here and then that would give you one big composite can you see what we're doing new fair values established and then you can either say what imagine we were down here and the price of milk went back into rotation or stayed in rotation do you remember the expectation if you're in rotation you expect to stay in rotation and where would you go to the other side so you could actually trade milk price at the edges it could be 90 cents for example could be $1.10 either side and you just be playing this wouldn't you etc etc see this is based on what static value so my point is that this is the milk market what's the difference you only know this is milk because I've told you it's milk this could be the oil market guys this could be any market can you see this volume profile applies here we've obviously discussed this to death in ultra market theory and you know it's in a way it's kind of amazing now I hope you really see how ridiculous it is when people say that markets are anything else but just people agreeing on price right and it's amazing that you can apply composite analysis to milk but is it really amazing not really because can you see firms are doing this all the time they might not draw it like a volume profile exactly but you can bet your bottom dollar that on their computer systems they're merging areas of what areas price points where people have transacted what market orders again and again and again they don't leave them separate they merge them don't they they may not be doing it using Sierra chart merge merge of course not but they're doing that that's all they're doing and you know at the end of the day what I've shown you here it is amazing that you can apply this to milk and I'm and you know I don't want to go off the topic but it's important to recognize that all that's really happened is this has been happening since human beings sort of walked the earth right now this is gonna sound crazy but let's be honest this is what happened we are barbaric creatures thousands of years ago you know we may have been chopping people's heads off and using that as a form of sort of price determination and swapping with each other for another good or whatever then obviously we got into more traditional forms of barter where you obviously might swap cheese for bread or whatever and then obviously it's become cash you know in the last however many few hundred years and then more recently it's become cashless guys at the end of the day this process right of seeking value doing an exchange between people market orders versus pending orders it's been going on for thousands of years the thing is it's just been distorted in financial markets by you know and I always bash retail social media but it's not it's also media mainstream media has you know really distorted what's actually happening they've made it into something why it's just marketing really creating sensationalism as you've seen in retail it allows people to convince you that these things are it's this line it just use this line and it's easy it's not is this let's be honest it's damn difficult to really figure out exactly where value is and you know you've seen that now because I've already shown you obviously value from an intra period perspective I've shown you value from a sort of historic perspective but it's just been distorted into this kind of I don't know some sort of game that belongs on its own that can easily be predicted and really let's be honest it's complete nonsense the reality is this is what's going on the market is constantly seeking fair value so how does this anyway how does this relate to static versus dynamic value well let's look at this the milk market what's exactly going on here well I said to you that when we come back down to $1 right I said to you that there was some obviously structural issues in the milk market and cows got a disease or whatever and people were hesitant to obviously drink milk and then the the issue got fixed where are you going back to okay well we already talked about this it's obvious you're gonna go back to where the price was before when these problems weren't there right where else is there to go and I'm not gonna don't worry I'm not gonna bash indicators I know I've done it to death but and I did talk about in that introduction to AMT section there so I won't repeat the point but clearly this process is going on but it's so relevant to this section because what's basically happening is potentially the price wants to go back to here and start to basically continue forming transactions in this area because it's happy that's what everyone agrees market orders and market sorry market buys and market sells market orders buy market orders and sell market orders I apologize are meeting each other and happy right and then you're doing what you're building more value area sorry volume within the prior area but this what is this is fair value already established can you see that this was established in the past the price of milk was between 140 160 150 in the past sometime maybe months ago then we broke out and you see we came back to it it's already established right it's no different to what I showed you on the merging of market profile or volume profile in the past it's closed it's done it's already been established and me I call it static value okay it's not a term you're going to find in a book anywhere or as far as I'm aware it's something I've sort of decided to call it myself because it allows me to really in my hypothesis distinguish it from dynamic or developing value and I'm going to explain to you why that's absolutely crucial but I want to make this point again just because I call it static value I don't want you to think oh my god Envy's created this amazing thing that we can use to make money and it's static value Envy static value no it's not okay at the end of the day it's just composite value I've just given it a name don't mean anything okay just need to make that clear I don't care if you want to call it you know if your name's John call it John's value if you want to if you're Jennifer call it Jennifer's value I really couldn't care less I call it static value because to me it's fixed right so a better analogy or thing would be or not analogy but a better example for you to call it would be you know you call it fixed value if you want or historical value or prior value I really don't care that's my point don't think that because I've given it this label it's my label it's not I'm just doing it to categorize it in my hypothesis all right so I think that's pretty clear but the crucial point is do you see the value area low and the value area high and I'm getting tongue-tied today and the POC point of control they're fixed they're not going to move so therefore I can develop my hypothesis around the value area low the point of control value area high this one here the point of control and then the value area low knowing it's not going to change right so I can have a hypothesis for example whether we are here and I expect the price of milk to go unbalanced and this is what I want you to do I want you in this section to start thinking about and I'm going to show you how to do that is to start thinking about lines in the sand in terms of static value that's why I call it static value because in my prep for the day I have a different section for static value and I have a different section for developing value and I'll tell you why that is is because I have certainty over this line I know it's 140 do you see I can start developing a hypothesis saying if we break below 140 what's the value expectation we're going to go in balance can you see that if we break above 140 what's the expectation we're going to go rotational that's my hypothesis for the day can you see it obviously I can take into account POC value area high you can do as many as you want my point is these lines in the sand contextual zones if you like people talk about zones a lot don't they these sort of zones that I see drawn on FX charts and whatever which in my opinion you know my customary it's a load of rubbish I'm going to say it but it is this is really a key sort of zonal area contextual area it's going to help you develop amazing hypotheses because it means something right what is this value area low based on market orders buyers sellers underlying sort of data that's driving that number is what market orders that's what had you on the depth of market it gives you so much confidence knowing real people buying and selling drove that sort of contextual area for me so I can be confident if I break it the markets likely to go in balanced and then obviously we would go to where the next sort of area of fair value which is obviously on your expectations framework if we break back through this contextual area that I've got in my hypothesis it's going to go rotational and where's the target the other side so that's why I like to break that out because that's one part of my hypothesis but how do I know as I'm approaching say this area or let's put it a better way because actually the reality is right the market isn't going to move in a straight line down there's various things that could happen what if this started happening I come down and we've gone imbalanced right and we start to do this can you see this line is going to stay fixed sorry this line my value area load that's going to stay fixed because it's from fair value already established in the past right what's this this has got a VWAP this is on my day and the VWAP is flat so what's happening on an intraday basis I'm rotational well hang on a minute we just said that if we break out the value area load of the previous composite or wherever a composite value is historically what expectation is to go imbalanced but can you see on a day basis intra period basis the market is telling us hang on hang on hang on I'm not ready yet I mean balance I'm not saying if the rhythm is 2SD market condition on the day is what balanced rotational what's the rhythm 2SD for example you could have your 2SD there and the 2SD there I'm not saying you can't take shorts because there's confluence there between value area load and the second standard deviation of the intraday condition guys this is true confluence confluence of what market orders right now I hesitate there for a moment because it's not obviously exactly market orders it's the descriptive statistics based off of market orders as true a picture of the underlying cause of what you're seeing on your chart effect it's as close to confluence as you're ever going to get you're not going to get you know you can have your whatever your MACD's this and that they're all complete garbage at the end of the day it doesn't mean a thing if this trend line crosses with this moving average and logic behind it you can't believe nonsense right and we've already been through this this however is telling you on the day and we've been through this million times through the probability sections and even in the VWAP section this second standard deviation is based on what what is it actually describing it's describing the spread of market orders and it's telling me their rotational on the day fair value in the process of being established developing the day so the VWAP right and what is this value area low again it's a description of where fair value edge of fair value is for what market orders that have taken place historically so when we combine the two gives us clues as to whether the market is really ready to satisfy the condition which we've established in our hypothesis according to what where the market was before so again let's think about this this is just rotational right what if I'll just give you one example what if the market did this what if overnight the market broke out right and it went down like this and then it started going like that and then you come in in the morning and actually let me let me widen this up a little bit so I can draw the bands in properly okay that's better okay so overnight session over there and you've got the new RTH right so this is coming so what's the VWAP probably done it's probably kind of done something like that right and maybe you've got your standard deviation bands that's your second standard deviation maybe that's your first standard deviation and this is your so this is the VWAP right this here and this is your first standard deviation second standard deviation band right so that's the VWAP the price is doing what on an intraday basis what's the market condition it's imbalanced and it's starting to get aggressive as you come into the session but we just said when we go below the value area low of a composite based on static value we're at our expectation is to what go imbalanced but hang on a minute on an intraday basis what we doing we're going imbalanced up do I really wanna do I really want to sell that no I'm not going to sell that guys you know when the markets doing that until what I get a condition change if we start to fail for example and we start to what go rotational I might take a short if we start to develop what imbalance the other way then my imbalance condition here on a static basis and my imbalance condition here on a dynamic or developing basis can you see they're now aligned this helps me so much because it it sort of helps me think okay relative to previous fair value previous buyers and sellers where this they saw where fair value was where do the investors today think fair value is do they agree with that do you see it helps me fine tune so I hope that's clear that's what we're doing when we're combining the two is we're trying to determine when we come in on the day what's the current investors doing are they agreeing with my hypothesis that we're going to go imbalanced relative to where we were according to fair value already established and you know just so I didn't lose anyone let's just go over that again is that essentially don't forget this milk market has been trading this range for a long time it starts to go imbalanced down right but that's relative to where it's been trading the last month the last year the last whatever these are new sellers coming into the market now I know you think of milk as two-way market doesn't matter fine you can even think of it here that we went imbalanced up to go back to this composite area right in fact let's do that let's do that because we can look at it both ways then if you think about it let's say the milk market is here and we come out we break the value area high it's good actually because it lets us look at it both ways and I'll show you applies both ways milk prices start to grow go up and we go imbalanced but how do I know that the people that are actually driving the market how do I know what the current feeling well I don't know by just looking at it relative to where we've been I need to know on the intra period basis are we rotational right again VWAP is here well if we are either I want to look for what confluence here and take it off the minus 2 SD because that's the rhythm it's very different guys if overnight you might say to me well hang on investors were the ones that drove it to go imbalanced yeah but we don't know what happened overnight what if new people came into the new RTA session and then just before pre-open and decided actually we don't see value going up i.e. imbalance we don't agree with what these guys did we're actually going to start to drive this back down and then so it's a terrible drawing so just bear with me so I'm gonna draw this properly we're actually gonna you know so it's a terrible drawing but you you see the point gonna be doing transactions below the current VWAP wherever it opened you know that might be overnight you come in and there's your RTH guys if that's the current market condition there's your 1 SD sorry terrible drawing the standard deviation bands but if you've done the VWAP section properly this should be just oh yeah I see what he's doing that is what slow trend fast trend doesn't matter the point is you're imbalanced down you're forming heavy market orders going down why would you play this as a continuation as an imbalance according to a static value framework you wouldn't you'd wait wouldn't you you'd wait for this to change market condition to do what have a reversal day the stuff I told you about you failed so all these sellers bail and then not only have you got you know these investors that came in and decided milk was basically too cheap there's been a structural change cows are healthy whatever the reasons was but also the new investors have now at this point because you've had your reversal day agreed with you right because until that point overnight they didn't they were selling this market you see there's conflict between what's happening intra period and what's been happening that's why I just find it crucial to split the two things out so I can actually figure out what are investors doing and where are we relative to where we've been before can you see they're two different things albeit the analysis is based on market orders everything I do guys is based on market orders okay this market orders are the very fabric of what is driving the market we talked about it for 10 hours probably longer this is why because I want you to understand this isn't indicators this isn't even these lines I've already said why you got obviously be bit flexible with them it's more the thinking and it will give you more confidence knowing that the obviously areas that we're using as as context are based on the fabric of the market which is real people buying and selling that you saw on your dome that's what's driving this value area high and also this behavior the behavior of the VWAP the behavior of the standard deviation line so we're combining them all together so we're going to have a look at this on the chart but let me just get rid of all of this because it's got a bit messy but I did want to make a point and that is that static value right I don't want to get too sort of complicated but we've already been over this the reason why we look at composites is because weekly maybe like that that's essentially the market going as in being rotational here imbalanced then being rotational there so you've got value here and you've got value here it doesn't make sense the way that in my opinion obviously a lot of institutions do it the software does it is that they will just say oh that's a value area there clearly no it's two distributions you need two value areas that's why I split it out so what are we essentially doing is we're saying let's split this out and have one day that could be Monday that could be Tuesday terrible drawings and then maybe nothing in that gap and then you might have Wednesday Thursday and then maybe Friday here so what we're doing we're combining these two this and this I'm just making it into one composite so we can have the value area which what is representative of this right equals that and then we have this combined right and that's your composite so I just put C here and get rid of that get rid of that and that essentially is this can you see so we've now got our two value areas because that's one and that's one that's what we're doing you know we went over this before the reason why I'm saying this again is because just because we did that doesn't mean that this is not another form of static value of course it is it's just a single day and it's closed it's not going to change and as I said to you if you can't find any composite value areas then you just use the prior date right and that's it really guys I do split them out like I said what I want to do now is I'm just going to show you this on a chart to just sort of solidify the learning from this page and then we're going to really think about how we can combine these two for trading strategies there's a couple of bits and bobs I want to finish off before we do that but let me just show you quickly this on a chart and then we'll move on okay so what I've got here is the crude oil market it's a little bit earlier in the year but don't worry it doesn't matter I'm just using market replay just because it's late in the day and stuff and it's quite useful for me to use that function which I'm going to get you to use when you do this but let's just remind ourselves exactly what we've just talked about but on an oil chart doesn't matter if it was bread or whether it's oil would you agree we're going to merge these three right first two we wouldn't merge and then obviously three days haven't gone anywhere so so in my opinion we should be merging these three and there you've got composite value okay I'm just going to extend this out a little bit so we can see it easier so we've had the market balancing in this area we come in to the next day would you agree this is going to go into my static value hypothesis all right it's a composite okay but at the same time just technically speaking can you see that static value is that going to change is that moving no it's not is this ever going to move these areas obviously we might get rid of them obviously if we get a huge profile balancing over it I'm not talking about that I'm saying is this value area are high but that particular composite period ever going to change no so it goes in static value already established this may as well be guys right I mean you know now you guys should be experts on auction market theory and this should just be like yeah that's obvious envy $1.50 milk that's $1.40 and that's $1.60 do you agree because in this period the price for how many three days was just going up and down static it's never gonna change so in my hypothesis I would write it down I would call this and I'll talk about this later but I do call it composite value area that's that part of my hypothesis I like to have a contextual level a line in the sand right so here it's 6204 I would actually probably write down you can do this however you want guys I don't want it to be too mechanical don't fall into that trap don't make your journal an indicator right you know I'm very anti indicator got to do things differently to obviously you know get out of the crowd I'm not going to give that whole speech again we said it hundred times and plus everything even your hypothesis building build it in your way I used to print these off and draw my hypothesis on them before I started when I first started I used to write it down and I'm not very good at writing things down honestly I'm rubbish right it's actually embarrassing how terrible I am at being organized writing things down I've got pieces of paper everywhere I'm useless but everyone's different but when it comes to printing things out and doing it and drawing I even used to draw my actual VWAP for the day where we were overnight I should draw it out I found that easier when I showed people in my firm they were like you're crazy why don't you just sort of make a proper journaling notes and whatever I tried but it didn't work for me but personally it does seem to work for most people and I have seen incredibly successful people write it down so my point is just do whatever works for you and we'll talk about this further don't worry I just want to make my point here which is that I might say to myself all right so let's see where we've traded overnight you know we may have traded like this let's see so we open here and then we went down and then we started to trade back up on my composite value basis what have we done we've broken the value area low guys what's the expectation to go in balanced so clearly we're looking there might be a composite sort of value area here you know like this historic static so it goes in my static section what's the static level again I haven't shown you here and I don't know but it doesn't matter I'm just making it up but in theory if there was do you remember what's the target when we go in balanced the next area of composite value well obviously it's like the milk price when we leave one dollar because the cows got healthy where did we go back to 150 the next fair price in oil I don't know what's happened here maybe you know demand global demand is collapsed or whatever the reason collapsed is a strong word but essentially something's driving the price down you know I've already said on a day-to-day basis I don't believe fundamentals they're too volatile I'm not saying they don't drive the market over over a few days when volatility of news dampens out and you can actually see the clear picture of course it drives the markets but otherwise it's what it's imbalances of market orders we already know this so it could be imbalances of market orders yeah some investors thoughts might be driven by fear of demand falling or whatever my point is that there's some shift there's something's changed and it's driving the market down where's our expectation is to reach the next area of composite value but that's on a static basis what about on the day basis intra day intra period what if as I said before in the bread example sorry in the milk example this is your VWAP and that's your first standard deviation what are you doing what's done what's the market condition see balanced up and what's the rhythm strong you know normal trend first standard deviation do you really want to be shorting into that I don't you can I don't want to I'd rather wait market condition is what the investors today this morning are telling me that they don't agree with these investors that cause the imbalance overnight there's conflict let them fight it out and you remember what I said to you wait for a reversal day wait for the condition to change wait for this to tell you we're not in balance maybe we're going rotational fine I might take a punt there let's be honest guys punts a strong word but you are taking calculated bets right but doing it in a professional way none of this squiggly line stuff it's a calculated bet I showed you probabilities based on the fabric of the market market orders coming in driving it down and maybe we might go rotational but I'm gonna play the top and scalp off the bottom or not scalp but sorry scale off the bottom apologies I'll take that back and scale some positions out in the hope that what I'll hold some for ultimate target but this all started at my CVA hypo so I would have had my hypothesis why and we'll talk about this don't worry my hypothesis might be what's my key contextual level for today is 6204 below that I'm expecting an imbalance what's my target 60 20 okay however I will then have a different area within my journal hypothesis the developing value what's happened overnight hang on a minute something's wrong imbalance up conflict wait what's the conclusion is wait for condition change that does say condition change even though it looks like a different language I'm sorry my writing is terrible that does say condition c-o-n-d and then Delta change hope that makes sense that's all we're doing so would you agree static static this is all static it's never going to change whereas you see here I can't call this static because the value area value area low constantly changing throughout the day drive myself crazy I can't write a line in the sand so at this 6204 constantly going up and down all day we can do you keep writing that in your journal no come on this is why I split out my journal in this way or I used to when we talk about journaling and you know I'm quite transparent but I'm gonna be honest with you it's all in my head now right but that's a decade of work that's got me to that stage where I can just look yep we're clear okay look at all the different ten different values yeah this looks clear this looks clear sometimes I'll be honest I do like to write on my chart just a little note or something maybe what my conclusion is for the day but I don't go through this process but I went through this process rigorously to the point where I would print this out every single day I would draw my VWAP line in overnight I would do my hypothesis on the chart and I would have it in front of me and then every hour I'd be monitoring condition changes so on and so forth and they help me they help me to develop real deep understanding of the market but obviously you know you move on and you get better doing things again and again and again and again thousands thousands of times you don't need to do it but that shouldn't concern you I want you to do it like this all right and then you'll develop that over time and we'll come back to this my only point is I wanted to show you the same thing that was applicable in the bread market you only know this is oil because I told you it was oil this could easily look I've even written the price be the price of bread and then we come down here and then it's a similar kind of thing right maybe we do establish some balance we break out and I'm not going to do the example the other way but you get my point so hopefully that makes sense and then finally let's on this chart I just want to cover this point that all static value was dynamic at one stage and just give me a second because I'm going to hit play on the market replay function all right so I've just started the chart and in fact let me just squeeze this in and bring across the chart all it is basically I just want to show you this it's ultimately the same thing that static was once dynamic so give me a second let me just fast-forward this it catches up okay so basically let me pause this what's happened is these are RTH profiles right and this is the overnight session so don't forget these profiles if you remember they're only based on 9 to 2.30 for the pit session obviously right now as you can see it's 9 p.m. at night and actually all I've done here if you're wondering what those lines are I'm going to show you how to do this don't worry for this task when you do the composites you see how it just appeared on the intraday chart see now I'm going to combine static which is as we've already established this with dynamic okay which is essentially this so there's two ways of looking at it I can prove it to you is that this day here part of this day if we split it out okay this day here was this day was this this session here essentially let me do it with a pen this session here the RTH session was this basically my point is at one stage it was an evolving profile wasn't it that's all my point is this is now static but before the day closed it was dynamic or developing that's all I'm trying to show you but you know just in case you're still a little bit lost it's fine don't worry it's the first time you've seen this merge profile begin merge profile end there we go let's just play it and I'll show you on a new day so again this will have to obviously catch up because it's not gonna open here until 9 o'clock so it'll make sense in a second let's just keep fast-forwarding this what I'm doing I'll show you the replay function which I'm going to show you as well I'm just forwarding one hour at a time but if you want you can just obviously play at different speeds you see you see the markets now just moving without me doing anything but I'm just gonna play at normal speed but just fast forward in one hour blocks just obviously for the in the interest of time so we're just coming into the open almost and the profile should there you go did you see the profiles open there profiles opened we've now come into the new session so would you agree this is static it's not going to change the value is not going to change it's the previous price of bread or whatever you want to call it this is developing okay terrible writing I do apologize but it is developing we just have to take my word for it that that's what it says and if we carry on the day do you see we're developing this profiles changing let's let it play like a few seconds I'll just speed up a little bit right you can see it essentially this is changing and look it's developing I showed you this in the VWAP section look can you see my point is this look if I wanted to if I wanted to draw in some value area lines right it's not gonna work because look we're gonna change can you see the changing look value area low shifted down it's going down now do you see it's moved can't use it guys I can't it's moving all the time do you see the value area low is moving now that's obvious I'd be here literally all day long moving this thing can you see it's just shifted obviously it's shifted because the VWAP is moving down market orders are building lower you see that's my point it's developing that's why I split them up because a static one it's gonna stay forever like that you see I have to keep changing this throughout the day it's ridiculous so I use the VWAPs as we've said the VWAP give us the developing how it's changed but at some stage it's going to close isn't it so let's just let me move this let's give it a second fine let's just speed it up you okay so it's now after what's basically happened is it's after 2.30 it's closed that has closed so if we just keep moving let's get this thing speeded up a bit can you see this profile is now stuck okay and got a little bit clogged up there don't worry about that it's because it's because I've got too many days of data that's all it is don't worry about that too much but basically just got clogged up a little bit because my because obviously my charts have been open for a long period of time that's what it is the data is getting a little bit clogged up but the point is that look this is now the new day what were we looking at that day that day was developing right I've written developing about this thing what is it now static I can use the value areas of this day now the sessions closed I can use the value areas and you can see you know if we were if we have that as our sort of line in the sand under our CVA analysis and we had under our developing value area analysis that we were sorry terrible right what's the market condition here imbalance slow trend speeding up guys I'm gonna be getting short don't know imbalance down what's my target next composite probably take some scale somewhere you know obviously that we can talk about so hopefully that makes a lot of sense you know that this was developing it's now turned into static all right let's move on to the next section and we can obviously continue our learning of static versus dynamic value okay so on this slide as you see I've put a table together you can print this out this really going to help you with your sort of journaling or you can just memorize it to be honest this is not complicated okay it's just summarizing exactly what we've already discussed multiple times I've just summarized it nicely for you so there's no confusion and essentially as I said and I'm going to talk about this don't worry in your journal the first thing I want you to think about is your hypothesis for the day relative to where we are in terms of the composite the static value areas that you've marked out so you know obviously I want you to start thinking about you know what we might be able to achieve in terms of the line in the sand and then obviously the expectation for the day are we expecting to you know go imbalanced or balanced now the problem is or I found historically is when I used to do my journaling or if I would write on my charts I like to separate the sort of market condition name that I gave to static value and to developing value so basically what I call them is you can call them whatever you want again like I said you know and it's a bit tongue-in-cheek but it proves my point you can call it John's return to value pullback or Jennifer's I really don't care okay don't think that Envy's come up with this name amazing system he's given us no that's that's no that's not what's happening I'm just helping you create a hypothesis by bucketing things that's all giving it a different name imbalance is imbalance is imbalance is imbalance whether you call it what I call it all it is and you'll see this as you're doing a journal why I do this right what I'm essentially doing and actually let me show you on a chart it's going to be much easier okay so as we said the market can let's say the market opens here in the morning right so it's closed overnight opens up and then we're doing whatever we're doing doesn't matter don't worry about the overnight condition or anything like that and then we come into RTH and then we start to move up or whatever point is you've got your hypothesis right so you've written down all right composite value area a and don't worry we're gonna do this quite a few times as part of before I actually start you on the task I'm gonna replay charts for about a month and we're gonna do this together so don't worry about it I'm just kind of obviously just laying the seed and introducing it so you know hypothesis for the day composite value area imbalanced what's my expectation expectation is well aligning the sand right and don't worry you can do this ending I know I keep doing them in different orders that's because I don't actually do this stuff anymore but obviously I want you to do it line in the sand is what 6204 okay what's my expectation my expectation was below 6204 now I could write imbalance here but I write I would write breakout or value right because you think about it what is my expectation below here it's for us to breakout value pull back right so we're here it's almost like breakout value pull back so I would say basically breakout value pull back I just I don't want to write the whole thing so I can just call it a breakout pull back breakout value pull back is my expectation for the day below 6204 and above 6204 is I'm expecting return to value pull back okay great sorry you'll have to forgive me it's been a long time since I've actually had to write this stuff down um let's let me do that again I do apologize let me just do this again and don't worry I've actually come up with a section where I've written all of this out for you so it will be you'll be able to organize it but this will make a lot of sense okay so expectation less than 6204 is what breakout value pull back and then expectation above 6204 is what return to value pull back and like I said I used to print this out as well I wasn't great you can see I'm terrible at writing it down I used to be terrible at trying to write this stuff down so I would literally have this as my hypothesis a I would have can you see return to value pull back they're just pulling back returning to value and obviously our expectation is the other side of value this is what I find it difficult to write this stuff down I'll be honest with you can you see it's just so much easier when I can say all right that's hypothesis B and in fact let's do that in a different color okay so that would be my hypothesis B and then I might have a third hypothesis but let's not get into that right now but you know I could have a third hypothesis in theory where I just expect this to be rotational in this area here it's a little bit advanced but this is what I used to love writing it down or sometimes I would do it on here you know you can find this it's called epic pen it's quite good I think you can get it free and I just use my mouse and just draw them out whatever works for you guys you see I don't want it to be do it this way and it's a system I just give you kind of what I'm looking for you to do and look at the end of the day we're all adults we can figure out a way to do it if you're completely stuck by all means please reach out to me and I will give you something that's absolutely crystal clear but you see the gist of it I'm trying to come out with a hypothesis for the day what's my expectation it doesn't have to be like this you know what it is is right now I want you to keep it simple okay I want you to just literally have the value area low as a line in the sand the value area high this sorry wrong color pen as a line in the sand this one okay and I want all your expectations to just follow the value expectations framework well this actually starts to describe my trade expectation so when I'm above do you see that now when I'm above 6204 what's my trade expectation to return to value above here I expect it for now I just want you to keep it simple keep it according to the expectations so it's just literally you're always going to have two expectations let's worry about all the other ones that I do later it's very advanced and if I show that to you now you're going to get very confused and what you can also do I used to do it I don't anymore because it's just in my head honestly if I'm breaking out of here and I think we're doing what I'll break out of value pullback and we're going somewhere I just know we're going there I don't write it down or anything but because you're just starting to develop a hypothesis for the day let's say this was a composite value area what you can start doing is you can number them so that's CVA A that could be B and where's your target CVA B got it start to organize things in that way don't worry we're going to do this anyway we'll do it together and you can come out with your own I want I've intentionally left this whole journaling process a I'm so rusty and I haven't done it and I'm just being honest with you rather than just making up something and I will show you the template as I said we'll get into more detail journaling this is really just for you to get going so don't worry about it be confident have some confidence and just coming up with your own way of doing these two hypotheses keep it very basic have your I think I had actually printed out earlier because I don't even use it and I was hoping to be able to bring it into play but this what was it I can't remember what I called it institutional value expectations framework I just want you to use that for now even forget about the one where you know we're developing some value above VWAP and we're going to break out just just keep it simple for now basically I want your line in the sand to either be this or this side and when we are below it what's the expectation well we've broken out of the value area so the expectation is for us to go in balance and therefore it's going to be breakout of value pullback okay so under the CVA section we'll have our expectations okay so you can either write the line in the sand but you see I've just put 6204 it's a given expectation is what for this day oh when I'm below my line in the sand 6204 is basically to do what breakout pullback breakout of value pullback and I forgot to put the so 6204 I'm so sorry I mean I told you I haven't written stuff like this down I can't tell you how many years it's been since I've had to write stuff down like this I told you I don't do it anymore but we're gonna get you then don't sort of do exactly what I do because you won't you know I had to go through the process I used to be religious about this stuff like I said I used to actually print this stuff out and I would draw my hypos on I didn't ever used to really be that great at writing stuff down but if you I suggest you try it so you know hopefully this gives you a good idea of the sort of thing I want you to do above 6204 so it's been that long I can't even write the price down properly but 6204 is what I return to value pullback okay so hopefully that was clear let me just get rid of this chart and then the other stuff is just literally what you're already used to we've discussed it to death before I'm just gonna basically have the market condition for your VWAP let's just stick to that for now and then obviously the rhythm and rhythm isn't really typically something we would make a note of when it comes to static value it just doesn't make sense because we've obviously already got the rhythm when we're looking at the VWAP when we're doing the VWAP that's where the rhythm comes into it we've already taken it into account so let's move on to the next one thing I just want to clear up and then we will get on to the charts but there's a couple of things I just want to clear up one or two things okay so on this slide I just want to like I said I want to do some tidying up and literally it's going to take five minutes there's a danger as you overcomplicate this okay and I see loads of people talking about this whenever we actually accepted through a certain contextual level so you know that could be your line in the sand when have we actually accepted through it when have we actually accepted through this honestly I see some of the most ridiculous things out there on this people say it's got to be 50% of the the swing up and all of this before no you've got to do this you've got to do that the true answer is you want to see some value here the problem is with that is obviously you want to see market orders built above a level before you say it's actually accepted above gone in balance relative to where you were previously in terms of static value and therefore you can look at breakout of value pullback so you see breakout of value pullback entry what it is is for me ideally I would use volume and sometimes I do again it's very sort of judgmental you can use that if you want but the problem is think about it if you traded here in the morning you're gonna have volume there you then got new volume it's very difficult to kind of gauge or have I got enough am I seeing a build-up is that new market orders coming in do you see what I mean it can start to get very messy so I do like to think of these this notion sorry of acceptance so I'm just going to tell you what I have honestly you can do it differently if you want it really doesn't matter as long as I see the market have some clear air you know like that above I'm happy to class that as alright we've moved on we've moved outside can you see this and the reason it's important is because look at that look at that guys look at the difference can you see if you did like if that had given you an entry for example then you're looking that's your line in the sand right and remember you got your hypothesis our expectation is if we go below whatever this level is that I'm looking for a sort of breakout of value and then a pullback and then an entry to go where to my next area where is that is that it do I wait for it to come here do you see what I mean but you kind of take a sort of intelligent like guess at it right or use your judgment clearly would you agree that is very different we just haven't firstly if you had a profile down here can you see the problem sometimes with using profile it's like I literally have to squint my eyes and check how much have we because you could have a profile here and it's very difficult to gauge how much in terms of market orders you've actually printed there so I just like to eyeball it and say do you know what now I want to see this this will become clear as we go through the charts I want to see some something like that see some real you know something like that even that's pretty okay do you see that sort of borderline it's a problem with markets right very very tricky very very tricky and this is why no two people will ever ever ever do the same things always because what do you do in that situation I can assure you 50% of people if you line them up would say yeah we've built enough value below the value area low for this to be considered what imbalanced or potential breakout of value and then a pullback in an entry or actually I don't know it's not enough I want to see honestly a little bit more down here and then a pullback do you see what I mean this I think is pretty clear right I think you've had quite a bit pause this for a minute pause have a look at it look at the subtle difference between that where you've had quite a bit print above and clear air look at that what a grey area isn't it that you can probably I think let's be honest 99 out of 100 people are going to say no that's not enough 100 out of 100 people are going to say no I'm not going to take that as having you know broken my value area low that probably not in fact I think 99% of people would say no me I wouldn't take that in a million years that depends on my conviction if I'm really convicted on a trade I'll take it if I'm not do you see this is why the markets very dynamic depends what's your conviction rate what's your sort of strength behind the trade so hope that was useful we're going to come back to this don't worry quite a few times I just wanted to introduce it here so you can have a think about this whenever we actually broken out of the value area high of the value area low tricky isn't it so that's what I would call sort of acceptance and you kind of see it also in these value area levels on the VWAP think about it here or here even let's imagine this was going up like this what's that kind of a slowish trend and it's changed the market conditions changed is that enough probably is but you see sometimes you get things like this happening can you see this end of the day it's just a standard deviation band what is this what is this acceptance level value area low what's this value area high guys what is this it's just a developing value area high it's the first time division that's all it is it's a developing that's a DVAH so it's the same at what point can I say are the market conditions change can you see if this gives me clear acceptance below I probably would say all right market conditions change but can you see it didn't it only just blipped down printed some market orders and went back up similar to this you see I want you to pause this for a moment think about it this is very similar to what happened here isn't it right and this is what's happened there you see we just dip below and then we went back up so it applies for any value area level I'm kind of looking at this I'll bring it up a few times don't worry I just want to lay in your mind don't worry we'll keep talking about it when we do the examples this is what I mean by acceptance hopefully that was clear I just want to go through the candles and then we do one little section I think on entry exit and then we'll get on the charts okay so I just want to quickly talk about the Heiken Ashi candle because I'll be honest with you I don't use it okay but I think it's very useful this type of candle to help you develop your market condition and rhythm and just develop that understanding of what is the current rhythm of the market but also it's going to help you in terms of initiating some entries and I'm going to show you that later because the way that I enter and exit the market is it's so advanced it's you know I can't ever put it down on paper it's impossible and I don't know any professional trader in the world that could write it down on a piece of paper it's something I've obviously developed through screen time and I'm going to talk a little bit about it how I enter the market very dynamically using order flow using sort of averaging a cost basis method where I'm playing around with my average cost it's like a core satellite approach that many portfolio managers use and it's something I've developed over many many years so I recognized I needed to come up with a way for you to be able to at least get started you know it's impossible I can't bridge the gap between what we're doing overnight you know it's just not going to happen but rather than you me just deserting you guys obviously I want to come up with a way that's going to get you started on that development journey and I like the Heiken Ashi candle because even if you think about it if you look at my charts right in the discord you've seen them I don't even I just use high-low candles literally I just got black high-low candles throughout the whole thing I like to just do it by by like I like to 100% use judgment but that takes time to develop and I'm even talking about market condition rhythm all that type of stuff you know if you see me do it but the point is that for you to start I think the Heiken Ashi is great because if you see in my opinion it makes the swings quite clear you can see clear oh didn't mean that to happen sorry swing comes down well it's pretty much a swing up isn't it just clear blue swing comes down up down up down and then probably up do you see it's very clear guys try doing that here it's like down up yeah maybe that was down there and then I'm not sure about that because we had a little pullback here oh but we've got another little pullback there actually then I come down but then there's this pullback here and then we're going down and actually is this up and down or is it just up yep that's down and then see it gets very messy here up down up down and then up and then is this necessarily down I don't know go up look at this here where you've got this swing down look at it it's all down and this is look you had a little pullback there and then down and what it does is it's basically smoothing it I'm not going to go through the maths of it it's pretty straightforward to be honest it just dampens things when you get a lot of movement by taking the average that's all it's doing it's not some secret indicator honestly I don't use it okay that's how much of a holy grail it is that I don't use it but I think it's great for you to start off with keep it on for a few months until you take the stabilizers off and you're able to just sort of become very good at marking what you think is the sort of rhythm of the market market condition those type of things I think it's personally quite handy I'm going to show you how to take it off I'm just giving you options and I'm going to show you when we talk about entry why this is incredibly useful when it comes to getting you starting you getting entered into the market it's by no means the answer I don't use it myself but I think it's a great way to get you started at least so you can start on that journey and you don't feel like well he's just left us to find an entry method for ourselves we're going to talk about that in terms of this whole fallacy that exists in people's minds that there's some sort of entry method that works universally isn't it's complete garbage people have told you so marketing scam because obviously if someone tells you I've got the perfect entry for you here's your stop-loss you're gonna buy it if someone who comes from a professional background like me tells you look sorry the best traders in the world don't trade like that you're gonna be like nah but that guy he told me I can do that so I'm gonna do that and all of you have tried that clearly you know it doesn't work that's why I always say and I'll be honest with you when people always message me and say oh you know could you tell me a little bit more about what you do and stuff I always say to them have you done any of you know the retail methods before because if they haven't I know they're just not going to be able to accept this concept of there's no perfect entry method but I'm gonna get you started so look that's the Heiken Ashi candle if you want to use it use it your choice if you don't want to use it don't use it if you want to do what I do I just keep things clean do what I do but I think it's a great thing to just you'll see when we go through the charts the rhythm is so clear on this it's actually something I noticed but only afterwards because someone showed it to me and I don't particularly use it like I said but someone showed it to me a few years ago just I happened to look at it a colleague of mine showed it to me said have you seen this it's quite good these smoothing candles and obviously at the time I've mentioned in the footprint section you can see the Renko and I was looking at different options for footprints and stuff and someone mentioned this to me at the time so I thought oh that's quite interesting it seems to you know show the swings quite well but obviously by that time I was already quite advanced and you know it wasn't for me but as I was developing the course it occurred to me yeah do you know what this Heiken Ashi might be a great way to get the guys and ladies that are doing this started in terms of obviously measuring rhythm and getting them some sort of attempts or ways of entering the market that they can then go on and develop into more advanced ways so look that's the Heiken Ashi candle like I said it's your choice I'm actually going to end this now we're going to get on to the charts but like I said I just want to talk a little bit about entry methods because I know a lot of you will be keen thinking where's Envy going to tell us to enter and put our stop-loss you know guys you've got to remember this is a professional course institutional course it's not going to happen like that but I'm going to get you started so don't worry I've got your back I'm going to get you started but you know it's not going to be the long-term solution for you but it'll get you started so let's talk about that I'll see you in that section

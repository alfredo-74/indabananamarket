Alright guys so now we're going to watch the market move in real time. It's obviously recorded. I've just recorded it maybe about an hour ago and the reason I've recorded it and I'm not going to show you in real real time as in live is because as you'll notice the market's moving so fast it's difficult for me to slow things down and obviously pick things out and show you what's going on because at first don't be too hard on yourselves. Maybe there'll be some of you who this will be easy for but I think it's fair to say the majority if it's the first time you're seeing it a lot of it's going to go way over your head. Don't be too hard on yourself. We're going to go over this lots of times and you will obviously have the opportunity to practice on your own so look it's absolutely normal. Over ten years ago when I was doing this for the first time in a professional environment I was like I'm never going to get this but eventually it came with time and practice so like I said be easy on yourself. Now before I start this live replay what I just want to go over is summarize what some of this stuff is because whilst you're watching it live it's going to be very helpful for you if I just remind you what's going on here so this is the time and sales obviously that's the price which is reflective of the bid and ask as we said the volume is the aggression so what's probably going to be easier is if I just move this over just for a minute and I just show you actually if I just move the time and sales out of the window just for a second so what I've done to make this really understandable for you and to get my point across and why we are so focused on the futures market is I've actually brought here an MT4 or retail platform MetaTrader 4 so what's happening guys is if you go in and click on type it's going to give you two options it's going to say market execution what's going to say pending order right if you decide to use a market execution and hit the buy or sell button you hit buy for example that's going to show up on this column or these two columns depending obviously that's buy that's sold and BOT bought is just something used in institutional circles as a shorthand for BOT and if you click sell then it's going to show up in this column so this is the aggression that we talked about before you're actually going out there you're hitting buy you're making an immediate decision to buy the market what you see here which of course is not on the time and sales but is on the depth of market is the depth that's why it's called the depth of market so that's showing you the actual supply that is for example if you were to click on type and hit pending would you agree if you place the buy limit you're not actually buying are you and you can choose the price so what institutions are doing and a lot of these algorithms like automated machines doing this but for the purposes of keeping it simple let's just assume it's other institutional traders they'll be doing the same thing things guys but on an institutional platform they'll be placing pending orders so this could be one person it could be 68 people it could be two people of 34 contracts each he's gone in on his platform and he's put by limit he's put 127 84 and then he's put the size now here I've just got out five lots but it could be anything so he could have put 68 you could put one like I said and it all accumulates and it's just placed there so that's the intention guys that's the availability so what you're gonna see when I hit play is this gonna change quite fast people are putting in limit orders constantly that's the intention you won't see that on the time and sales what you will see however is this and this is what you see on a volume profile footprint so on and so forth I don't want to talk too much about those things because it's going to get confusing for you but when I move this across I'm gonna get rid of this because you're watching too many things at one go will obviously be too much for your senses to take in especially it's the first time you're seeing it but what I will do is I'm going to keep this chart open and I want you to see how it's the execution and changes in demand and supply and the interaction between that and what's basically going on between the two middle columns and the outer two columns that's causing this price to change now there is actually a couple of steps in between this price changing and this price changing just and I have to tell you this because otherwise it's not entirely accurate because this is the spot market and this is the futures market that's why there's an ever so slightly difference in price so here is 127.88 for example or obviously the bid side is 87 and here you see 82 that's just because it's the futures market in the spot market and there are certain steps things like arbitrage and hedging that cause these markets to stay in tandem but this is as close a reflection as demand and supply you're going to get because of the nature of the foreign exchange market being a spot market OTC a lot of the flow is proprietary you won't be able to see it however because of arbitrage and hedging factors this is a very very accurate reflection of true supply and demand and it's actually beyond the scope of this module but I want to say it now because we're here and I always tell people look if you can trade foreign exchange but try and leave that till much later in your career because it's very advanced because of this particular reason when you're trading the e-mini S&P 500 or crude oil those futures markets are so large relative to foreign exchange and there isn't much of an OTC market at least in terms of immediate risk-taking for oil and the S&P futures that they essentially reflective of almost hundred percent of demand and supply whereas obviously this is a sample again if none of this makes sense to you don't worry we can revisit it as we get more advanced just for now know that this is a very very accurate reflection so and I'm going to prove this to you because when you see this demand and supply change you're going to see the retail platform change and that will obviously prove it to you once and for all that actually it's this the interaction of volume that's causing this to go up and down it's nothing to do with any silly indicator and that's why you've obviously tasked me with teaching you the same things a professional firm would so you've got imagine if you're sitting right now in a professional firm guys this is what they're going to show you is moving the price and in fact like I said you won't even see a chart and the reasons for that will become obvious once we go through this example why you don't actually need a chart especially not for the first few months so I'll pause it a few times anyway but hopefully that helps when you're when we actually press play so let's go ahead and cover this up let's press play and like I said I will pause it but let's just let it play for a few minutes so here you can see actual orders hitting sell so there you can see there's quite a build-up of sellers coming into the marketplace and that's reflected in the market going down so it's actually these sellers that are driving the market down guys and there you can see this intention will be changing all the time you just saw a flurry of sellers come in that caused the market to dip down again there you go big flurry of sellers again causing the market to dip down again and you're going to notice here the intention start to increase to sell that also adds a little bit of pressure and we are going to come back to this there you go look at that that shot up so let's just pause it there a second so what happened there I did scroll it just to keep this in the center but essentially as you can see here a lot of sellers coming in and like I said you see this these numbers on the footprint this area but let's put that aside for one moment and what's actually happening is you're seeing a lot of aggression come in they're basically hitting these bids these are people who want to buy the information we're interested in for the time being is this the time and sales and I intentionally let this play because I just want you guys to see how everything comes together in terms of demand and supply and the chart moving notice how no indicators guys nothing to do with an indicator I can assure you that a significant chunk of this volume are automated machines being used by hedge funds and banks to place orders based purely on what you see here which is a volume build-up and it's these guys there is no technical indicator in any of these algorithms it's pure volume trading that's what they're basing that buy and sell decisions on so we're going to pick up the action again and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to clear all these you'll see me that's me controlling the mouse I'm going to clear this area just to keep it clean because I want to highlight how these orders are reflected on the time and sales because that's the whole purpose of this video so let's just pick up the action again so there you go I've cleared it now let's just pause it when we see the next print coming now I just want to point out guys you can still see this flickering a tiny bit now the reason for that is have you noticed how in the futures market it's to four decimal places whereas in the on your retail platform is to five decimal places you may remember I think maybe ten years ago brokers decided to increase on retail platforms down to five decimal places now all that means is is your brokers own algorithm based on liquidity pools that it has access to is deciding incrementally between these two where it wants to give its own bid and offer to you that's why you see excuse me that's why you see this flickering but it's actually not moving in terms of a whole pip so just because this is moving doesn't mean anything it's when it moves one whole pip is that actual demand and supply is driving that the actual incremental adjustments tiny that you're seeing that's your brokers algorithm just moving I thought I'd just point that out because people might see this moving without this actually printing so let's pick up the action and see if we can actually I believe a bid comes in I can't remember but let's say a bid comes in I'm going to show you how that's reflected on the time and sales there you go so you saw ten come in there and you've seen 18 on the other side so let's see how that is shown on the time and sales guys so would you worry ten people sold 127.77 and look what it did cause the price to really crank lower let's have a look here 127.77 so you see why I have to keep I can't show you this in real time because by the time I come over here guys this will be two miles down markets moving very fast in real time so you see ten so let's just have a look at the ten here can you see big trade just come in few moments ago and the time is actually look how incremental the time is so 127.77 yeah matches the price now let's count this together three four five eight nine ten okay matches the ten then immediately and this could have been some sellers taking profit we won't know for sure this is why I say in a professional environment they get you watching this thing because like I said I watched it for six months without a chart reason being if I see sellers coming in then obviously I kind of know in my mind that the chart looks like this I don't need a chart believe it or not you this happens over time it's like driving a car at first you think I'm never going to be able to drive this car it's impossible but it just becomes almost second nature right you can talk on your phone you can do about ten different things at the same time as driving a car that's what happens over time now let's have a look at this 18 someone immediately came and bought 18 contracts does that reflect here yes it does look at the price there 127.77 127.77 again guys let's count it together 13 14 15 16 17 18 I'm just gonna pick up the action again and then just finish it off they go another three came in so let's just clear that now the price was different right before we saw 10 at 127.77 now we saw three at 127.76 is that reflected in the time in sales yes it is 127.76 sorry if you can hear my dog snore it's incredibly unprofessional my dog is snoring in the background she's very very old and sleeps most of the day so I do apologize and if I put her outside then she'll start to cry so please accept my apologies on that so yeah you see the three there two three add those up and bid trade so it's in the bid side which is the sold column okay guys so that's your time in sales there's three examples I've shown you how that is reflected in there actually what's happening is the data is coming from the exchange into your platform and then really this is it in its raws format and that's why I wanted to show the time in sales first and that is reflected in these two middle columns so we're not going to really look at the time in sales it doesn't really help us because we've already got the information we need here and this will then feed the footprint volume profile so on and so forth now that's a little bit advanced I don't want to confuse you at this stage but just know that we're going to put this to one side now the time in sales we're just going to focus on the depth of market in the next module because the information that you see streaming down here you can see it staring at it it's not really going to help us when we can actually have it nicely compacted the same information on a depth of market and this time we can also have this extra bit of information as well all in one nice area as well as you may have noticed those of you that are eagle-eyed the volume profile so everything is nicely together on one platform and just check this guys a lot of volume built up in this area you can see it here so the reason I'm highlighting this I know it's a lot to take in right now and we will keep coming back to this but that's why the market is moving away and then back and away from this area it's because the volume profile build up is in this area but again that's very advanced I'm just saying it for the sake of completion we'll come back to it we'll just finish off for a couple of minutes or maybe just a minute and then we're going to summarize on the next slide so I'm just going to let this play out there you go you saw some more sellers coming in now some buyers are fighting but that's all profit-taking there people who've just taken short positions there have just dumped back up so I've cleared it again they see nine and let's count that together two three four plus four is eight plus one is nine on the bid side at one twenty seven seven seven six can you see that there guys so the time and sales works you can see again this is flickering up and down again like I said it's the fifth digit if you actually watch this closely it doesn't actually move even one pip that's your broker just own personal algorithm to the fifth decimal place but as soon as this moves one pip this is going to move an entire pip okay markets just taking a little breather because it's just had a decent chunk sell-off so again just to give you another example this time you see 17 here guys actually what happened is in between these 17 buys happening at 7.7 there were sales coming in so fast this is why I say there's computers involved as well algos because actually these 17 are bunched up in between a number of sell trades so 1 2 3 6 9 10 11 and 6 17 yeah but in between you've got 3 1 4 7 8 can you see there's only one there because those 7 3 4 5 6 7 guys it happened in a blink of an eye you didn't even see it if you actually slowed this video down very slowly you'll see those 7 happen so quickly which suggests there were algorithms involved there at that stage so again just gonna let this play out for a few more seconds and then we'll end the slide okay some some more sellers coming in a little bit of profit-taking but sellers still very much in control there you see so guys because I've been watching this so long I can tell I spent a significant part of my life watching this thing go up and down so obviously for me I'm kind of trained to see this but I can see straight away what happened there is you saw there was one big contract order I think it was over 50 contracts what someone was probably trying to do is fade this move and he got very quickly run over so what he did himself most likely is he dumped and that's what you saw coming on the other side and that's why you saw a little bit of a flick up and then it just quickly went down again so the guy himself was exiting position and it probably wasn't a guy it's probably an algo just trying to take a little quick tick or two again this is just my theory but that's what you'll be doing throughout the day when you watch this over and over again and you see it repeat so many times then those are the little things you're picking up so we'll come back to this much more in the advanced course especially in terms of depth of market and what all these things are likely to mean but the main thing was I wanted to show you how the depth of market is reflected in the time and sell so I hope that was helpful and I hope you can now see that there's nothing on the chart guys that's making these algorithms and institutional traders buy and sell in terms of technical analysis guys it's literally they are watching what the intention is like a hawk going up and down and we're going to go now watch the depth of market again many more times and actually what I'm going to do first is I'm going to show you how the depth of market is reflective of supply and demand in all markets in the world for other types of goods and then we're going to build that up into the depth of market so again hope that was helpful we're just going to summarize and then we'll move on to the next module

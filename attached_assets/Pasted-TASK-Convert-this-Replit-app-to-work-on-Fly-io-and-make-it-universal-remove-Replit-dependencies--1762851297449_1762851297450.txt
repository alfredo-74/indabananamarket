TASK: Convert this Replit app to work on Fly.io and make it universal (remove Replit dependencies)

CONTEXT:
I'm deploying this Express/Node.js app to Fly.io. The app was originally built for Replit but needs to work standalone on Fly.io infrastructure.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
Fly.io proxy cannot connect. Error: "[PC01] instance refused connection. is your app listening on 0.0.0.0:3000?"

FILES TO MODIFY:
1. package.json - Remove ALL Replit-specific packages
2. vite.config.ts - Remove Replit vite plugins
3. server/vite.ts - DELETE THIS FILE COMPLETELY (replaced by vite-dev.ts and vite-prod.ts)
4. Move files to correct locations

REQUIRED CHANGES:

═══ 1. MOVE FILES TO CORRECT LOCATIONS ═══

**CRITICAL:** I see these files in the ROOT directory:
- vite-dev.ts
- vite-prod.ts
- index.ts

These need to be MOVED into the server/ folder:
- vite-dev.ts → server/vite-dev.ts
- vite-prod.ts → server/vite-prod.ts  
- index.ts → server/index.ts (REPLACE existing server/index.ts)

═══ 2. DELETE OLD VITE FILE ═══

**CRITICAL:** DELETE server/vite.ts completely
- This old file is replaced by server/vite-dev.ts and server/vite-prod.ts
- Keeping it will cause import conflicts
- Make sure it's completely removed from the codebase

═══ 3. UPDATE vite.config.ts ═══

In the ROOT vite.config.ts file, REMOVE these Replit plugins:

DELETE these imports:
```typescript
import { replitDevBanner } from '@replit/vite-plugin-dev-banner'
import { replitCartographer } from '@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer'
import { replitRuntimeErrorModal } from '@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal'
```

DELETE these from the plugins array:
```typescript
replitDevBanner(),
replitCartographer(),
replitRuntimeErrorModal(),
```

Keep only the essential plugins like:
- @vitejs/plugin-react
- @tailwindcss/vite (if present)

═══ 4. REMOVE REPLIT DEPENDENCIES ═══

In package.json, DELETE these from devDependencies:
- @replit/vite-plugin-cartographer
- @replit/vite-plugin-dev-banner
- @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal

═══ 5. FIX PORT CONFIGURATION ═══

In server/index.ts (after moving it), find this line:
```typescript
const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '5000', 10);
```

CHANGE TO:
```typescript
const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000', 10);
```

═══ 6. VERIFY SERVER BINDING ═══

Ensure server.listen() call looks like this:
```typescript
server.listen({
  port,
  host: "0.0.0.0",  // MUST be 0.0.0.0, NOT 127.0.0.1 or localhost
  reusePort: true,
}, () => {
  log(`serving on port ${port}`);
});
```

═══ 7. CHECK routes_stable.ts ═══

Open server/routes_stable.ts and verify:
- Does registerRoutes() return an HTTP server?
- Does it call server.listen() INSIDE that file?
- If YES → PROBLEM: Remove the listen() call from routes_stable.ts (server should only listen in index.ts)
- If NO → OK: It just returns the server object

═══ 8. VERIFY BUILD SCRIPT ═══

In package.json, confirm build script includes ALL THREE files:
```json
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts server/vite-prod.ts server/vite-dev.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
```

═══ 9. CONFIRM PROPER IMPORTS ═══

In server/index.ts, verify imports are:
```typescript
import { log } from "./vite-prod";  // NOT from "./vite"
```

And dynamic imports use:
```typescript
await import("./vite-dev")   // NOT "./vite"
await import("./vite-prod")  // NOT "./vite"
```

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
After changes, verify:
✓ Files moved from root to server/ folder (vite-dev.ts, vite-prod.ts, index.ts)
✓ server/vite.ts is DELETED
✓ server/vite-dev.ts exists
✓ server/vite-prod.ts exists
✓ server/index.ts exists and imports from "./vite-prod"
✓ vite.config.ts has NO @replit plugins
✓ No @replit packages in package.json
✓ Default port is 3000
✓ Server binds to 0.0.0.0
✓ Build script compiles all three .ts files

FINAL RESULT:
The app should:
✓ Start without crashing
✓ Listen on 0.0.0.0:3000
✓ Have NO @replit dependencies
✓ Have NO old vite.ts file
✓ Have clean vite.config.ts
✓ Have all server files in server/ folder
✓ Work on any cloud platform (Fly.io, Railway, Render, etc.)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Keep ALL functionality working
- Only remove Replit-specific code
- Don't remove essential dependencies like express, vite, react, etc.
- The app uses vite-dev.ts for development and vite-prod.ts for production
- Fly.io sets PORT=3000 automatically via fly.toml

Please make these changes and show me what you modified.

⚙️ Replit Refactor Command — Market Monitor System

Objective:
Transform the current project into a market monitoring and signal visualization system, keeping only the IBKR live data stream. Remove all other functionalities, archive legacy files, and document the new system flow.

1. IBKR Connection

Preserve only the IBKR live market data stream.

Remove all components related to order placement, execution, or auto-trading.

Clean up any functions, modules, or scripts that perform trade actions, handle positions, or manage accounts beyond data reading.

2. Remove Trading and Automation

Delete or disable:

Any autotrading logic, bots, or automated strategy scripts.

All trading buttons or UI elements that trigger orders.

All execution modules (buy/sell logic, order classes, broker bridges, etc.).

The system must remain read-only — no trade execution or modification capabilities.

3. Archive Legacy Content

Move all outdated or unrelated files (including markdown descriptions, old strategies, or deprecated utilities) into a folder named /archive.

Include timestamped notes or a brief comment in each archived file describing its original role.

4. Interface & Layout

Adjust layout so the interface fills the entire vertical page height.

Retain the Account Window as a mockup only — no active trading controls.

All other windows should focus on market visualization, signal monitoring, and analytics.

5. Documentation Update

Create a new markdown file named UPDATE_AND_FLOW.md at the project root.

This file must contain:

A description of the current system architecture (modules, data flow, and responsibilities).

A step-by-step flow of how the system launches and operates.

Clear instructions for running the updated system.

A list of archived files and their previous functions.

6. Deliverable Summary

After refactoring, the system should:

Display real-time market data from IBKR only.

Provide signal visualization and monitoring features.

Contain no trading, no automation, and no bridge dependencies beyond IBKR live data.

Have all obsolete files organized in /archive.

Be documented in UPDATE_AND_FLOW.md.

Hello ladies and gentlemen so welcome to the you know the task section and I've done the video already on static versus dynamic or developing value whatever you want to call it and look we're going to start basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to do about 30 days as quickly as possible obviously I can't go as slowly as I want you to go you can take your time about this and you can I'm going to show you how to use the market replay so you can do this great thing is you can do this any time of day okay weekends you don't need to use the live market if you don't want to ideally if you can obviously do it in real time if you want to do it in your own time because you're not available obviously when the market opens are happening or the market is actually active that's fine do it in your own time then do at the weekend so I'm going to show you how to use the market replay you know we'll talk about that when we're on that but what do I actually want you to do this for well firstly it's obviously bringing developing and static value together talked about at length in the video developing versus static value which is value which is the sort of precursor to to this this is me just showing you what I want you to do and obviously giving you some examples so you have a frame of reference but you know one of the main things is as I said is I want you to start developing this hypothesis building and this is really look I'm going to show you a journaling section there's going to be a whole big section on that but let's get you started right this is why I don't have a very sort of clear way I want you to do this is because honestly it doesn't matter as long as you get to a point like I said I used to print it out if you want to print it out print it out maybe be environmentally friendly don't print it out maybe you want to write it out type it out whatever you want to do or you can just put it on the chart if you want I'll show you how to do that it's basically just put text or just type it on the chart whatever everyone's got their different ways of doing it okay that's why I don't want to restrict you because then it becomes too mechanical and I'll keep saying that I want to move you away from this mechanical mindset to discretionary mindset which everyone is capable of and that's where you're going to build your edge so enough on that let's at least have a rough guideline of what I want your prep to include and I talked about a lot in the video so the section dynamic versus static value but what is it ultimately going to look like so I did say I want you to have a ideally a section where you just look at composite value why do I say that because it's static right very much looking at how's the day developing relative to where we've been before right and also sets our trade expectations so I want you to think about the lines in the sand it's either going to be your value area high obviously I want you to mark the POC if you can and then your value area low so these two typically are going to be your CVA composite value area lines in the sand then as I said already in that section I just want you to have your expectation trade expectation versus this line in the sand and we'll do this together now so you know if it's say 60.50 I'm just making this up we're actually going to go through the e-mini because at the moment obviously oil is a very volatile market if you want to replay it look do the oil market right but just go back because right now is a very volatile period and I do trade it I've you've seen me trade it but look you know again I've been trading the market for years it's it's not the best environment for you to be learning on maybe in the future you can kind of you know look at when oil market ranges are a lot higher right now the average range is very high it's not conducive to you learning stick to the S&P if you want to do recent if you want to go back a few months and market replay crude oil hundred percent recommend you do it depends you could be watching this I always say you can be watching this in one or two years time five years time and the oil markets really quiet fine do oil for this purposes I'm going to do the e-mini it's not going to make any difference honestly but your expectation you know let's say is crude oil versus where your sort of line in the sand is and then just have it you know greater than he's going to be either it could be obviously you're looking for a breakout away from value so you know PPB or you're looking at a return to some sort of value area back to value right so okay and then obviously it'll be relative to that this will become clear as we do it and have your target that's going to be according to what your value expectations framework expectations framework and so put that down so you know we've obviously been through this you should have it printed out you know we talked about this if you're breaking into value and then you expectation is to obviously stay in balance or become balanced is to go to the other side of balance with your obviously scaling out potentially if you want at the POC and obviously if you're breaking out of balance the value area low value area high then it's very much to go in balance and your target will be the next composite value area right and that's why you can number them because you know if you've got say you've got a big composite like this and you know you restart the day there and then you start to break out of it and you could have an old one marked here that's going to be your target essentially ideally you want to get inside but you know to be on the safe side just take it to the sort of value area low and just to make your hypothesis easy you know you can call this A and call that B so you can just say you know expectation target is value area low B C B A B right that's your hypothesis for the day you can draw these on if you don't want to write it all down I'm leaving it to you to decide you know do whatever works for you I think visually it's quite good you can always just obviously just draw it on your chart if you want or whatever works for you really it's up to you or you can just make it maybe start making a note of it see how you get on and then move over to whatever try both and then obviously this is the you can call it dynamic or also to be honest I interchange a lot between dynamic and developing it's the same thing really I like to call this like I call this a CVA I like to call this the developing value area and what I want you to do is I want you to first mark the overnight condition so market condition rhythm you'll obviously have to be wrapped for that and then any failures or achievements okay so so I've written VWAP TP here so it's the believe you had that sheet isn't it the trade plan and the reason I've done that is because you can print out your sheet if you want but hopefully from the last exercise you probably know it by now market condition and rhythm that's really it that I'm looking for you to to obviously determine and then any failures achievements and we'll talk about this you know has it managed to obviously break your line in the sand overnight and fail which obviously adds more credence to the fact that you may obviously look to break out you know out of value and then move down to obviously the next value etc etc so we'll talk about this anyway we'll do it together and I'm not going to do this with you because obviously I don't have the time to sit here going through every minute or every hour but you know if you have the time I would and you know you've got nothing else on I understand if you have got plenty on and you want to go through it quickly it's fine but and I'll get you doing this later but if you do have the time obviously every hour or a couple of hours just make a note in your journal of any sort of changes that have happened in terms of your narrative has anything changed has the market condition changed on a developing basis has the expectation changed you know versus static ie have we now broken inside our line in the sand have we broken below the line in the sand what's changed how did it happen just make you know observations and notes as you can and obviously that's going to make your journaling process much better but we'll talk about journaling as I said a bit later but I think this is really crucial so you at least get started journaling all right let's get on the charts okay so here we are on the charts and look you might be wondering what's happened Envy have you you know had a moment with your charts no it's not that at all and in fact there's a reason why it's a bit of a mess it's because I want you to if you want use market replay I'm gonna use it obviously so I can quickly cover 30 days but ideally you just use it in the moment but like I said if you don't necessarily have the time to be there on the spot because I understand some people work whatever and you want to do it at the weekend you can use the market replay function okay so what you need to do basically is the reason I've done this is because you see I've got here the stage one profile chart book what I like to do I'll be honest with you I don't obviously I've been doing this for so many years now look I literally spent about a year where every weekend I did market replay probably longer than that the reason I didn't say few years is because I'm actually embarrassed to admit I gave up weekends for a long period of time but you know that was just me I'm not saying you necessarily need to do that but there probably will be a phase and anyway it's easier for you right it's more practical especially if you're not around every afternoon you work or whatever you want to do this in the evenings market replay is a brilliant function because you can simulate the market but here's my point the reason why it's a bit of a mess is because if you're going to do it I like to have the minimum number of charts because it can really bog it down otherwise if you've got stuff you don't need open because don't forget it's simulating everything it's going to have to reload and just the sheer processing power it requires for this it's going to be greatly magnified if you've got unnecessary charts open so for this I'm just going to do the ES so what I'm going to do is and I want you to do this I've given you a profile chart book just shut down everything we're not going to use so we're not going to use any crude oil charts so you see this I'm getting rid of anything that's crude oil right I'm getting rid of it just remove the chart yeah I'm not going to use this if you want to continue to use this in the way that I suggested that's fine if you want to maintain this to help you do your balances and stuff I'm not so I'm going to get rid of that let me just move this to the side so I'm going to get rid of that okay just see so you see I've only got two things now yeah so I've got the ES and I've got this okay then what I'm going to do is I'm what it is is if you're going to go back further like if you want to go back a few months and this is crude oil remember you can do the same process I want you to do the same process with crude oil and go back a few months right now it's incredibly volatile if you want to try it fine do it now it's not a problem I'm not saying it's a problem I'm just saying because you're at the beginner stage and work on obviously some orderly conditions to obviously boost your confidence and get some learning under your belt then by all means go to more volatile conditions but if you want to go further back then obviously you won't be able to do what I'm doing now depending on how much further back you're going to go but what it is I'm only going to go so I'm going to start with today you know no cherry-picking I'm literally just going to do randomly the last 30 days however I don't what is I've got basically if I go to chart settings you see I've got 365 days do I really need that my market replay is going to get bogged down so personally I'm just going to do 60 days that give me plenty of room going back the other 30 so I'm changing this to 60 I'm going to click on OK just remember if you do market replay and this has only got 60 days and you try to go back six months it's going to fail so you'll need to change this depending on how much back you want to go so that's loading and then here chart chart settings and I'm doing the same things you see it's going to help my system run properly when it does the market replay it's going to keep it clean and efficient there is a way where you can just link the charts you want to do market replay to keep all the others open but it just has its own issues I'd rather just rather than complicate matters for everyone let's just keep it simple and have a pure ES market replay let's just keep it like this so this is the market as it stands okay as of today okay so then you go file click save as and then obviously give you the option and you can just rename it whatever you want so I'll let you do that in your own time and in fact no let me do it so just give me a second save as and I'm going to save it as ES market replay okay and then in fact sorry I should have done that on the screen here but doesn't matter it's pretty obvious you just go file save as and it gives you obviously the opportunity to change your chart book name okay so you still have your original chart book you've just created a new chart book called ES market replay and what that's going to do is going to enable the market replay to run really fast okay so just give me a second I'm going to organize this nicely and I'll be back in one second okay so this is how I've organized it you know it's up to you how you do it I'd like to have just a little so really you just need one screen you'll be fine you know you can have them side by side you can have them overlapping if you want you know you can have this you know full screen you can have the chart full screen whatever you want it's up to you there's no right or wrong way of doing this you can have one full screen then the other one you know minimize whatever whatever is comfortable for you right now we're not looking at the cumulative Delta we will let's just get rid of that as in just just minimize it down the bottom and I think we're good to go one thing I need you to do is obviously you've been drawing composites on here and I want this to now show on this chart so I'll show you how to do that if you just go to chart chart settings okay f5 and go to advanced settings 2 and it says copy chart drawings from chart numbers there might be something in there it should be blank but depends what what template I put in there just clear that if there's anything in here and I don't know what number this will be on yours the market profile so I'm using market profile blocks ES just make sure it's ES of course and I've got it can you see it will say at the top market profile mines blocks if you're using letters it's fine and it says hashtag which is number one what that means is that's chart number one so in here I want it to copy chart drawings from chart number one okay but yours might be a different chart number I don't know what that is okay and obviously just remember to make sure that you know and I've said this to you guys before but it's fine but you know because it depends when you're doing this and the template is it up to date or not or whatever just make sure that the contract that you're using is the most liquid contract obviously it's very late at night to be honest which is you know hands up I've obviously not got much of a life I'm doing this late at night but I find it nice and quiet outside and whatever I can really get stuff done so that's why the volume is really low but typically when you do this it may be much higher so you can see my ES June contract has got the most volume at the moment twenty one thousand nine hundred so just make sure that that's what's loaded right and if it isn't so I'm looking at ESM 20 obviously these are live contracts your codes going to be slightly different but ESM 20 let's go back to the chart have I got ESM 20 yes I do ESM 20 ESM 20 if it isn't you can just go chart perform future symbol rollover and I've already got it as ESM 20 it should automatically find for you then obviously the most liquid contract but don't do this if you've already got the most liquid contract because then it will move you to the next one which won't be so first check obviously like I said on the list as I've already explained in the foundation course and just make sure you've got the most liquid contract because you may be doing this in the future at some time and you know obviously contracts may have rolled over by then so we're all good to go we've changed this just make sure it works when you obviously you draw see it turned up there so just make sure that happens and now to use the market replay right it's just chart and you go to replay chart replay chart control panel so in mind went out of the screen and then this is the control panel okay and like I said there is this option where it's charts with same link number I don't want to confuse people all right at the end of the day if you've got 20 charts and you just want to to be the ones that run you can do it but it just confuses matters let's not confuse matters let's just keep the ones we need and create a separate template for it right most sensible way of doing it so it's all charts in chart book because you want both of them you don't just want single chart which would be this one you want all charts in chart book replay mode we're just going to do standard okay we're not doing anything heavy like doing any systematic algorithm testing or anything like that you don't need to calculate everything it's just standard replay it's very very accurate it's going to be perfectly fine and then I use start date and time typically I'll do five in the morning of the day because that's pre-open isn't it so we've got the 14th and let's go back then what about month so I'm just going to go to the 15th of the previous month which is basically a full calendar month then isn't it so what am I doing here it's American dating does confuse me sometimes but that's okay 1504 2020 five o'clock in the morning speed I'll just leave at one for now and then I'll talk you through all of this when we actually hit play so then you just hit play and it's gonna reset everything now I've obviously got a live account so but if you don't then I don't think it will give you this prompt but it obviously only it will only work in trade simulation mode so I'm just going to press yes clear all day yeah that's fine okay so now it's just going to take me back to the point that I've chosen 5 p.m. 1504 2020 you can see the markets already started moving working very nicely pause so okay so we're kind of where we want to be what the options so what it is is when I hit play I can play normal speed one times if you've got plenty of time in the day and you really want to just simulate the actual market do it at the normal speed right but obviously don't start at 5 in the morning because the action doesn't happen till you know around 9.30 obviously this is the e-mini S&P it's a bit of a longer day but I typically don't trade until about 9.00 9.30 coming into the open as I said so just make sure that that is at the right time and you know someone did mention something to me and I might just mention it here actually if you don't mind if I get an opportunity and I haven't already done this I may have already done this somewhere else I'm going to put a placeholder in about this but I realized that what you want to do is data trade service settings just make sure your time zone is set to New York because otherwise what it's going to do especially if you live in the UK and you don't live in the EST time zone it's going to use your computer's time zone and therefore your market profiles are all going to be wrong so I'm probably going to put a placeholder about this when you come to do the mergers anyway so I'm gonna so you should have seen this already but if you haven't just make sure that you've got the time zone correct okay and therefore when you're setting this time remember this is New York time because it's obviously US futures you want to be going in at 9.30 US time right so that's typically depending on obviously the time of year sometimes you get these daylight saving shifts don't you but it's typically five hours so if you're in the UK that's going to be 2.30 your time but when you're simulating this doesn't really matter but you know if it was real life obviously be 2.30 in the afternoon but yeah just change that because otherwise it will obviously go to it won't match the correct timings it will be your local times or whatever it is so just make sure that's changed and then so yeah coming back to the options when you play it like I said you just play at normal speed you see you're just playing it and the markets moving however what you can also do and don't forget this isn't going to move because obviously this will change when it opens 9.30 these are only RTH profiles right you can change the speed so we're playing it right now look you can change to like 15 times speed I don't have a recommendation play around with it see what works for you do you see 2.40 you're starting to really move quickly now isn't it speeding up big time you can pause it I've played around with both to be honest I've used different speeds I also like to I like to use I don't necessarily use these number of trades next bar any of that I do like to use this so hours minutes seconds sometimes I might jump by one hour if like it's five o'clock right now and I just want to quickly get to the open you see I'm just jumping one hour at a time that's pretty good I like that or you can obviously and then when you get close to where you need to be you can change it to guys I want you to play around with this you're going to learn by doing it making mistakes messing it up whatever play around with it to your heart's content and you know really that's how you're going to learn I'm happy to obviously show you the basics but look don't be scared of you know just messing around with it hit play look now I move every two minutes it's just every two minutes I like doing this when I'm getting into the areas might place a trade and then I'll just do skip forward about two minutes at a time now what I'm gonna actually do myself is I'm gonna go through this first day a little bit slowly but then I'm just gonna jump 12 hours at a time and I'm gonna show you essentially what I want you to do so I want you to do it at this slower pace okay obviously in the interest of time we don't have 12 hours to do a video I'm gonna try and keep this down to maybe an hour tops obviously say that might go on longer but I'm gonna try my best to do that so what I'm going to do is first is I'm gonna just put in some merges so I'm doing really rough and ready just so I can have something to sort of compare against okay so I'm going to merge that and that and then I'm going to that in right so you see it there don't really have anything up here so I'm pretty happy with that I think we're good to go now so I'm gonna hit play okay is it moving yeah let's speed this up so let's just do let's kick it forward one hour pause that one second sorry where are we just want to check what time is 8 53 so we're coming into the open let me just speed so the speed is one but let me just jump this forward a couple of minutes at a time can you see what I'm doing I'm just just moving it forward says 10 past 9 I just want it to get into the open basically and in fact it's actually a good time for us to do this I'm probably not going to do this for every single one but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a very I'm gonna do a terrible impression of a basic hypothesis on here but you know like I said you can cut this out you can do what you want with it really you can use this I use this thing called epic pen I think it's free I've got the pro version but it's I believe it's free and you can obviously draw your hypotheses in etc etc okay so what I'm gonna do is I've got it on because honestly I don't do this I apologize I'm gonna keep looking at the PowerPoint that I've put together just so I can roughly follow the guideline let's put our hypothesis so you've got two options right I've got this sort of what I call it T can you see text and therefore I can where is it modify text and I can type in here CVA you know what have I put here line in the sand is XYZ because what it is is we've got one line in the sand down here don't we and then we've got remember what I said we've got nothing above I've said to you if you don't have anything you can just use the prior value and that's fine okay I would be careful I'd make sure that you maybe change the color of that just so you know I'm probably going to choose a terrible color here but okay just so you know that's terrible just randomly picking color that's alright it's not great is it but it's better you see someone note that's my prior value it's not a composite but it's the best that I've got at the moment so what's my line in the sand do you see now I can kind of mark this so I'm not going to do it by text it's going to take me too long but you see my point you can go to text and you can do all of this slowly by text and you can say CVA line in the sand is what 2815 is that 2815 2815 what's my expectation might just be easy for you to write this down but take like two seconds instead of having to type it's just if you want I'm just giving you some different options expectation is what so below less than 2815 is break out of value pullback because we're coming out and then going down and then stroke greater than 2815 you can either you don't even need to put if you don't you can either put line in the sand and then just put less than breakout pull back greater than I'm just doing it the long-winded way but you know whatever like I said you know you can figure this out it's quite obvious greater than 2185 2815 is a return to value and we're expecting this to return to value and then your target you know is at the moment as it stands 2737 and then you can put here CVA I don't know B call it whatever you want whatever you want to call that it's a composite value area and then we go to the day VWAP and we say overnight let's have a look what's the market done overnight the market has it's clearly imbalanced right you can see that straight away so what's the market condition it's imbalanced what's the rhythm what I'm happy with either really you can say 0.5 I'm even happy with one it's just a standard sort of normal trend so I'm going to write that down normal trend what else any failures or achievements no really it's just broken out so you can you can put a conclusion right conclusion is what broke out this is the narrative you can call it narrative conclusion whatever you want broke out of CVA a because if that's B then that's a right well you can number them however you want you get the gist of it broke out of CVA a and developed value below NIS looks aggressive and potential for shorts but would prefer to wait for because the thing is if you think about it it's a little bit out of whack at the moment isn't it the rhythm is what very much you know we're heading down but if you look at you know the rhythm in terms of market rhythm you see it's probably ideally you'd want to enter somewhere there wouldn't you ideally would take shorts down to here okay so but would prefer to wait for SD1.0.5 something like that SD1.0.5 right that's that's a pretty fair hypothesis wouldn't you say I think it's pretty good options there is a way you can and I apologize if I can't find it but that's okay modify text functions select sorry for the delay there you go haven't done this in a while then can you see you can change the size like maybe you want it to be bigger font or something you can have that there you can have that there right it's up to you guys you can do whatever you want or you can write it down right the way I used to do it is I used to print it out and then I used to just draw on it and then eventually I stopped doing that and actually I just like to I even had a period of time and you see me I post in the discord my hypos why I draw them out so you can actually use this pen um you know just with a mouse like this you can draw them out so whatever you want however you want to do it in fact let me get rid of that I'm just going to draw it with a pen now Bob just makes it easier so we're currently there you know hypo a is what well we've written it here for us to come back here and then move down here that's hypo a okay this is how I would do it that's your what I would do is I would mark this and say that's my line in the sand I only want to be short below here and in fact you know what I would like you to do if you don't mind and I think you'd find this quite useful let me just start again is I'm not going to do this every time it's going to take me too long but what I think would be very useful for you is I don't want you to think of these as you know I said mathematically we get obsessed with value areas having to be I just want you to mark these in just create little zones you're going to find it very useful fiddle around with it you know you don't need the outline so I've got rid of the outline you see that chart drawing properties I've got rid of it I don't want an outline I don't want to have an outline I don't want to have an outline I don't want to have you see that chart drawing properties I've got rid of it I don't want an outline let's just make it a nice little zone right colour again just just do what you want right at the end of the day it's like whatever suits your personality it could be a someone who likes a bit of pink whatever yeah let's go for pink uh click okay great that's my line in the sand I don't want it to show price labels I'm going to click off do you see that don't want it to really show me the price labels and then you can pick whatever you want you see I've got my own ones that I've used in the past hypo hypo secondary 50 50 blah blah blah don't worry about all of that uh they're just ones I've used in the past and then you can put name nis whatever you want and then just hit save okay and then click okay and then next time um you know if you're drawing something just go chart drawing properties quick load five do you see just brings it up all right it's up to you just a little handy tip I think it's quite useful to have these as little zones so you don't get obsessed because then you know that you know I talked about the acceptance thing let's say you are here and you have a hypo you know it's really got to do that and have some acceptance above right rather than it being that pure line yeah when you write it down you can put your lis is 280 28 15 or whatever the level is but obviously that will give you some sort of leeway to have to build value above it hope you can see that I think that's quite useful to do I'm not going to do it every single time but I do think it's quite useful for you to do that and in fact we can even do it here chart properties was it number five yeah there we go so that is basically to sheena we've created a sort of map for us to say yeah you know what below here I want to be sure I want to be targeting here above here I want to be long doing what return to value and you know you're going to have your point of control there there's your point of control by all means mark it you know feels pretty good have it to mark that you can see that point of control there and you should see it marked here can you see it there okay because that would be like your scale out point or whatever you want to call it isn't it right so you can see we're developing now a real framework I hope you're finding this useful you can really see all the work you've been doing over the last few sections coming to life now you can see we've almost created this sort of map for us to start to trade around and it's a value map right that's essentially what you're doing so hopefully you can see you don't really need indicators and stuff this is this is true market order generated value areas which are helping you trade in and out of and you know there is one thing I should mention in that for now I want you to keep it simple just have this as your line in the sand when we're above it value expectation is what we've broken it we're going rotational when we're below it we've broken it we're going in balance as we get more detailed we will have times where we're going to be down here and I'm going to be targeting a return to value pullback from below because of whatever reason but it's going to be too complicated right now so just keep it simple have your line in the sand for the day you may have two line in the sands whatever it depends where we are obviously we could be in here right therefore you'd have this line in the sand and you're going to have this line in the sand and you look to obviously break out whatever you see my point but obviously for now we're here we know that's a line in the sand we want to be below it we've broken out of it you've got your narrative broke out of you know cva a so you can mark this as a that's b hope you can see that as I said I used to actually draw these in whatever I mean end of the day everyone's different find what works for you and then just observe it that's all I'm saying if you want to take executions do that I think it's quite a good idea if you want just to keep you in the game interested whatever hope that was very clear in terms of how to develop hypothesis so let's put that back so here what did we say we want to have hypothesis a is here so then that's here now my hypothesis b would probably be for that to fail okay what else could happen it could fail we could end up starting to go back here but for now I don't want that to you to necessarily trade that because like I said I only want you to be thinking about what exactly what is this you know I've said it here expectation versus here so below 2815 you're only looking for breakout of value you're not looking for the return we'll look at returns from outside later that's the next stage right now we don't have that as an expectation it's not in a hypothesis you can by all means have it in a hypothesis that isn't traded that's all I'm saying is you can say ah you know what it failed potentially we're going to go back and the market condition that I've got at the moment you know might change and go sort of back it could go rotational stuff we've talked about in length introduced so let's just play this and see how this plays out um apologies I did get rid of that but you know I've already said what I expect so it's about 10 minutes into the open I'm going to push this forward two minutes okay I'm going to speed this up a little bit 15 times let's speed up a little bit more so play sorry about that something happened you see sometimes it can get a little bit stuck don't worry about it just just just flick it a little bit can be a bit temperamental all it's doing is just loading data and if you fast forward it too much it needs to catch up with itself that's all it is so you know if you're fast forwarding a lot you're just going to have to accept that that's what it's doing so you saw the market open can you see you've got your new profile for the day there okay so what did I say I want to see it sort of in this region and we'll see if we can get a shorting and just whilst I'm waiting for that so if you don't want to use these candles right you can just get rid of them hide okay basically that's what you know I said I just use high low candles so that's what I'm doing if you want to and then you can just kind of take the micro structure breaks and whatever you want you know so you can just look for the market to break and then obviously put your stop but you know try to try the hikinashi I think they're pretty good let's pause that hold on one second show the hikinashi so we've turned there right you see it's gone I think that's pretty good actually maybe I have no idea honestly it could be a disaster but that doesn't matter if you see it's roughly within that region so let's enter a short position here obviously our ultimate target is here I'll probably take some out there or whatever you know just before obviously the overnight lows um so let me show you how to take a trade so you go to chart uh sorry you go to trade open trade window the chart and you're gonna see this it's up to you take two contracts four contracts whatever you want to do you're just playing around with it at the moment I'm not going to tell you how to split your orders up um and then you can go to target and then you can set these however you want quite so but let's go to main 24 hold on sorry it's been ages since I looked at this all right all right so let me show you what you do so depending on how many contracts you've got let's say we've got two okay what you do is you go to targets and let's just remove these what you can do is you can either just place the trade and then close it obviously but or you can have predetermined targets and then you can move them play around with them so that's what I would do I would add target one let's say I don't know let's put it at 20 ticks you see because you've got two contracts if you've got four you need to set different targets different targets target two and I put a stop in but we'll come back to that target two we're gonna have it at say 40 well let's do 30 you can play around with this stop which one do we want yeah we want stop stop and for this you can have I don't know 20 or whatever what my point is you can change all of this anyway uh and then you can click on main and then you can nope sorry about this hold on let me just do this again so we had uh let's just make this up 20 30 and let's put the stop at 20 okay what it is is you want to save this you go to m it's been a long time since I've done this I'm surprised I don't remember uh uh what is it confirmations no settings is it save configuration yeah save configuration and then in here you can call it whatever you want so let's call it two contracts if you've got four you can call it four just save that it's just going to save it for you okay so you can load up all these different presets okay so now we're gonna just slow this down to normal speed hit play I'm gonna sell the market okay there you go okay so you see I can now move these and say nope I want my stop here I want my first I want my final target to be kind of here I want my take profit to be there do you see what I mean you can just change them that's what I said don't worry too much so I'm short two at two seven seven one um I've got the same account okay if you want to show pnl there is a way to do it uh really being put on the spot here uh anyway you can see just watch the market there we've gone short let me come back to that in a second because what I want to do is I just want to talk a little bit about this stop because we talked about this before didn't we do you remember what we said so you've got options I've said you can enter how you want you can enter on the that sort of micro break so you would have entered potentially you can enter when the candle turns red as it's turning which is what I just did albeit one candle too late but that's okay obviously I'm just trying to give you an example so that's the entry dealt with now we're going to deal with the stop so either you can have your stop above here and I hope it's clear just zoom out a little bit either you can have your stop there just above that swing high obviously you would have got taken out there and then you would get back in or you can have it behind what I would not suggest but obviously it's up to you do you remember what I said where do we need to go to probably the previous area so it's VWAP really isn't it because the rhythm is kind of normal stroke 0.5 so probably around the VWAP you know if you're going back to the VWAP you probably failed obviously that means that your risk is much higher but it's up to you how you play it I'm going to speed this up a little bit okay 10 times 30 times okay so if you had been stopped out here hope this is very clear what I said to you before if you wanted a very tight stop do you see and you got stopped out and the market starts to turn again you have to have that psychology willing to re-enter it and your stop would go about there you see it's a different type of trade management I'm showing you different ways you can manage it me I'll just say do you know what I'm just going to put my stop now I'm going to relax I'm going to go off I'll be back whatever and actually that's not why I suggested it I mean you can if you want but when I show you cumulative delta it will allow you to really focus on cumulative delta and obviously you can start to look a little bit at order flow and stuff it's up to you at the end of the day obviously when you're up here you want to really make sure that you're going for your targets or whatever and you can manage it as well as the market starts to turn say you obviously take out your first target you're not going to leave it there you can you can start to obviously I don't like the word trail but yeah you can start to play around with you can move it obviously whatever to an area that kind of makes sense let's play the market honestly this is so random I have no idea what's going to happen yep there's the market turned does it take us out nope it didn't it didn't quite take us out did it just wait let's see what happens sorry there's a flight there um see if we get taken out nope it's just messing around isn't it I'll just speed it up a bit more it's really not doing much to be honest okay there we go so we got taken out so now what I might do is just move it up move it behind the lows just secure some of the trade and press play and we've had some aggression coming in I'll just move this down a little bit more obviously that's the final target I'm not really going to play around with that too much this is why I like the Heiken Ashi because it lets you kind of um without thinking oh the market's new swing micro swing micro swing you can kind of see look it's it's turning back now it's turned blue it's the first time you're thinking oh maybe there's a chance that we're pulling back slightly okay so honestly there's no right or wrong way I've told you this there is no if anyone tells you there's a perfect way of trailing it this that talking rubbish there isn't I'm going to show you cumulative delta so you can mix it up with this so what I might do here let me explain to you what I'm thinking you can just leave it honestly it's up to you but um for the sake of time because I don't know basically we've now moving from almost a slow to kind of a normal isn't it so because I've already been taken out of one it's just kind of again there's no right or wrong way I you know you can just leave it where it is if you want where is it at the moment it's fine let's just leave it there let's play see what I would do is basically if now this is why the Heiken Ashi is quite useful I don't use it but I'm just giving you some ideas you know as it starts to pull back if we can take out this low what I can tell you is there will be obviously a lot of people that probably have stops around this region so as we if we if we can take out this low you can just put your stuff along here and just manage it dynamically until the move happens I wouldn't do that I would stick with my you know VWAP idea or whatever it is that you're doing if you want to put it above obviously this swing and then get back in or whatever you want to do but once it starts to move you can start to lock things in you know and I think that's potentially a way of doing it is as soon as you break the low you move your stop above because typically what you will find is when the market rhythm starts to break down you will get a lot of people who will just head for the exits or whatever and you'll end up taking draw down or whatever on that position so sometimes it's swings and roundabouts but like I said it depends if you want to actively manage it or whether you want to do it a different way there's different ways of doing it you know I'm just giving you some ideas of how you might be able to do it or you can just leave it and see what happens let it let it mess around and come down whatever like I said I'm just literally I have no idea what this is going to do so just speed it up a little bit maybe a little bit more okay so you see how it took out the low here the market's starting to form a faster rhythm so you can move your again I'm just giving you an idea develop what works for you you know I'm just giving you some I think sensible suggestions that you know using the Heiken Ashi you can really say oh we just had a new low okay rhythms change slightly you know we're really starting to develop into you know we're starting to go pretty fast now so yeah it seems sensible to put it there and then you know if it broke that then I would put it there and just manage it all the way down okay so let me go and do this okay and then we got taken out so nice bit of profit on that now what I want to do is um basically so I did just pause the video for a sec and I did find it actually now because I want to give you the option of showing the P&L so basically I found it I just literally paused the video filming for one second there so I could go and find it so what you do is you go into chart settings and I knew it was in chart settings I just couldn't find it and it's in here advanced settings and you see profit loss format do not display you can change it to like currency value you see you made 975 dollars change it to points okay 19.5 ticks 78 ticks right for works complex currency value applied all right so I just want to show you that you can do all that you can play around with it just play around with all the settings basically to your heart's content don't be scared to try things just mess around with it so I'm going to go back to do not display and just leave it as that so yeah that's it I'm not going to take any more trades because obviously that took a long time to do and I'm probably now going to really jump ahead as fast as possible okay just to kind of maybe give you some more ideas around what I would be doing essentially but should I keep this here I'm not sure let me think about it let's move forward so like I said I'm going to jump quite a bit now if you don't mind maybe 12 hours at a time see if this works a bit hesitant to press the button because you just don't know what to expect there you go perfect all right so I'm just going to pause it I'm just going to jump and let's see what happened the rest of the day so you know I said for every hour obviously I don't want you to jump 12 hours at a time maybe jump an hour maybe jump two minutes maybe just let it play at a faster speed and I did say to you you know if you really want just get some really good practicing you know what happened market condition changed in it changed in it where did we go and in fact it was about here isn't it started to turn into a rotational environment did that present any trading opportunities not really look that was a line in the sand if this had happened if this LIS was here can you see great opportunities to get has something changed I think I've written that on the thing narrative of the development what has the market achieved failed to achieve guys can you see how failing to achieve something is just as important as achieving it so if I had my narrative right for the day of the developing day this is how I would be writing it out I would say modified text you know I would say something like I don't know later in the day one o'clock two o'clock whatever I'd be constantly writing 1300 you know slow trend going a little sideways right it is isn't it can you see here I'm not going anywhere just going sideways you can kind of tell this is in a sort of precipitous state there and then what around 12 30 sorry I've put one o'clock here really that's what my 11 30 isn't it oh geez let me check the time and then later on so what's this 12 30 call it one o'clock uh dva condition changed right okay um guys this is journaling that is finest right not even exaggerating the point this is proper journaling if you're in a professional firm this is the sort of stuff I was told to do every hour two hours write it down it really develops this amazing understanding um obviously we'll get into journaling later don't worry and I'm going to mention this again but it's all it is I just wanted to get you started one o'clock dva condition changed um what else has happened here failed to reach cva target cva target which means what uh sellers potentially have lost control right guys I'm doing this in so much detail I'm not obviously going to be able to do this for all 30 days in fact I'll probably just do it for this one day and hopefully it gives you plenty of ideas of what you should be doing and then obviously I'll just quickly talk through the rest of the days because obviously time's limited um so yeah can you see 11 30 one o'clock keeps hiking guys what does that mean sellers potentially have lost control failed this failure does what adds more probability to us going the other way but obviously the line in the sand is that probability to us going the other way but obviously the line in the sand isn't right if it was if this I hope that's clear if this was down here can you imagine the potential opportunity here because this failed right if it had achieved the target you know maybe sellers aren't bailing as much because they're happy they've exited here guys can you see a lot of sellers are stuck when it comes up here what are they going to be doing you know I'm hesitant to say the word because I don't like to speak out of turn they're going to be crapping their pants let's be honest they'll be bailing puking out of their positions here because they didn't achieve the target and they're holding their shorts that's why I say failing to achieve something is just as important as achieving can give you crucial contextual clues the other contextual clue was what condition changed from what and I should have written it here condition changed uh to where are we let's say you can write this down by the way of course don't need to write it up here let's control condition change to uh what did it change to rotation okay okay so hopefully that keeps you like this just give me a second I just need to check something on my recorder over here okay just want to make sure I'm not covering anything with my head um yeah so that's it condition change sellers potentially uh have lost control deviate condition change to rotational contextual clues narratives change maybe we have an opportunity but we don't because we are what's our expectation we can't play a return to value pullback until we get above 20 15 okay I mean in theory obviously you could play this rotation within developing value to just the other side but again that's a little bit more advanced you know I don't need to think about that right now but if you're already thinking about that then that's very good thinking because at the end of the day what's your value expectation when you are in a rotational environment to test the other side of value so there is potentially you could take it but obviously like I said it's a little bit advanced so let's now move on because I appreciate this probably taking a lot of time but let me keep that there let's get rid of this okay so that's that thing pretty much dealt with let's just fast forward that jump okay so that's no longer prior value that's prior value right so what I would do is I would move that or redraw it or whatever you're going to do remember guys I'm jumping ahead 12 hours at a time right you're going to be doing this more one hour at a time the market will not be even opened so your hypothesis is going to be done you know around this stage I want you to before the market open um to do that so potentially it's just a mess here isn't it isn't really any clear rhythm yeah there's nothing there shoot forward 12 hours so now what time are we at let's merge these two merge with next profile let's go back to normal colors because obviously it's a composite okay so we don't even have you know that's in fact we can't do that so that's not the prior value area um yeah we don't really have any levels but let's just move this okay so now we're at 12 hours and I'm going to be doing the same thing that's not the prior value area um yeah we don't really have any levels but let's just move this down move this uh down so that's that day let's just jump forward really there's not much is there let's be honest what is that why have I got that there let's get rid of that um there's nothing really on that day is there because we didn't have any really levels to key off it's the advantage of replay is obviously you can just keep fast forwarding isn't it so here actually prior value and I'm gonna just change the color of that um you can obviously load these again like I showed you you can call them tc6 maybe call that tc6 and call it prior value area save that okay so we'll have to do that again okay so uh let me fast forward this I'm obviously I'm not gonna go you know we'll be here all night otherwise and let's just see what happened and see how you could have played that okay so what would your line in the sand have been here move this up that move this up and in fact these are still lines in the sand isn't it copy and move drawing there I'm not going to do all the hypo stuff you know I did it in incredible detail you can see there let's see what were the trading opportunities here well think about it fantastic trading opportunities you've got as you came into this day right what were your options well you had your line in the sand at the open right where was it here and here um you've gone heavily imbalanced here probably not any trading opportunities I would suggest in this area then you failed right you failed and what have you done you've gone rotational and when we go rotational what do we expect to happen or when we break sorry value area low what do we expect to happen go we have this shift I've actually printed it out so I could talk it through with you the institutional value expectations framework right is what value area is broken expectation is to go balanced or imbalanced obviously I've put here vice versa so here the value area low is broken and we start to come inside look at this nice acceptance look at that guys perfect trading opportunity for you to get long and what's the target other side of value obviously you can scale this either at the VWAP or at the POC or whatever you want and actually where was the point of control it was there wasn't it I'm not going to bother marking it but you know it'd be somewhere here so you might be scaling it's the same point really isn't it around there you hold the other side what a great opportunity there and you see as soon as it turns blue or obviously if you have a micro structure break bang you get long right and you would have written this down wouldn't you because you wouldn't have had a CVA but the CVA would have just been kind of the prior value area and you would have had a line in the sand here wouldn't you okay and what would have it said it would have said you know your expectation is what greater than 2824 would have been what would you call it return to value pullback okay and then below 2824 would have been a breakout value pullback and in my opinion this was it was a fast trend it was very very fast it didn't really give you know there was no clear sort of rhythm here it just came down like that didn't it it's different if it's doing this do you see what I mean it gives us some sort of rhythm to key off didn't you have that you just didn't have it so it's very very difficult for us to actually get into anything there in my opinion and don't forget this exercise isn't about making money it's just to get you used to what using can you see developing value area with static value area can you see how the two complement each other beautifully if you want to go rotational right in terms of a we talked about this a lot if you want to go rotational i.e your expectation is to return back to value in terms of and have a pullback within this area what would you ideally want either you'd want this to be imbalanced up right you've broken in you're imbalanced up the new investors on the day are aggressive this goes in perfectly with your expectation on the value expectations framework I hope that's clear to go to the other side simple guys keep it simple for this exercise what's the alternative either we got imbalanced up or go rotational look and this is incredibly powerful because we've had you know if you're doing your 10 o'clock what happened was the market achieved failed to achieve this failed to achieve what your hypothesis would have been on this day right it would have been as we said 2824 less than 2824 would have been what breakout of value pullback and where would your target have been guys here you failed once you started to go back above this line in the sand this has clearly failed you've had acceptance above the guys who've got short guys they're going to be running for the exits massive opportunity to get along hopefully that's clear as you're writing things down we failed and we've basically now flipped to this would have been obviously greater than 2824 return pullback return to value pullback and then your target you know it's all there guys on your value expectations framework we just we're not doing anything different to what we've done before but we're just combining it all together now where you're using obviously developing value to help you trade static value it's all you're doing it's all you're doing okay um i just want to make sure i missed anything in that list um no nothing probably going to speed it up a little bit it i mean is it valid okay so let's take a look at this so let me just copy and down all of these areas are valid aren't they this one let's get rid of it that's not valid let's merge these two okay obviously guys you're going to do this a lot slower than i am i got 30 days to cover so i'm just sort of just jumping as fast as i can all right so we've got clear three clear static values for us to key off here so you know on this particular day we've obviously come into the market and our expectation our line in the sand is what 2737 so i'm talking about this day here forget about the fact we've opened overnight um so essentially we would have said below here would have been a return to value callback to what point of control and then potentially the other side obviously so we never achieved that so i'm just thinking would there really have been any trading opportunities here potentially there in fact that'd be a really nice trading opportunity as you came into the session here guys can you see plenty of opportunities to trade you come into the market what's the rhythm slow trend okay what's happened you come in you've accepted below this line in the sand okay you pull back and yeah i'm rushing through things but i hope you can see this there's so many opportunities to enter trades here you would have entered here maybe got a scale out you might have stopped out then nothing or potentially you might have wanted to get long here got stopped out then you come back down fail and then potentially obviously here there wasn't great acceptance here then you come back down and then potentially that probably wasn't enough of a sort of pullback for you to enter the market at this stage and you would have obviously wanted to target there then you came into a new line in the sand short scale out or you may have wanted to wait for this condition change to take effect so i apologize i jumped the gun a little bit there and i'll tell you what the way that i like to do it right with these condition changes is that let's say you're going in this slow trend or whatever it is and you see how it changes to a fast trend i like to see us pull back once test the fast trend and then if we go down and test it again i'm happy to enter because then the fast trend is established i hope that makes sense i like to see it tested once because i like to see that it's established so look first time do you see the the sort of rhythm changed here we almost went from a slow trend and we went rotational like i said you might have had a stop out trying to get long back into this sort of value area but you may not have taken this trade because probably the point of control is you're trading right into the point of control so maybe you wouldn't have taken that trade i'm not sure what the point of control is and i'm not going to check it but or you may have doesn't matter whatever you take the stop out whether it's here whether it's here whatever and then potentially you get short again because you're just going back into the slow trend but you see it's not the rhythm starting faster here almost the 1.5 bang we tested 1.5 once nope let's see does it stick we go down we come back take the short trade see if it sticks scale out and then maybe get stopped out of the rest or whatever and then we just turn too much the rest of the day plenty of trading opportunities this forms a big part of my day of my thesis but obviously i combine it with other stuff but it's good to just get you guys started at some of the things that i'm looking at all right let's now fast forward so all these look fine to me that's intact that's intact that's intact okay seems to have got bogged down again just give me a second it's because i jumped so much that it doesn't like it sometimes it can get seems to give it a second to catch up with itself there we go let me try doing it this way there we go it's moving now because i'm moving it 12 hours at a time it just needs a bit of time to catch up with myself that's what it is see if it works there you go yeah okay so i've got it to jump forward there so there you can see trading opportunities there look at that really really nice isn't it you come in at the open you pull back you've got this nice beautiful imbalance take it to the other side guys all right really nothing much else for me to say on that one then i'm going to skip forward again look at this beautiful line in the sand you might have got in there got stopped out and then condition change i'm not sure if you would have been able to get into that one you see look sometimes it's not perfect is it at the end of the day you know you're doing your overnight condition which is quite rotational and then you go into like a normal trend and can you see you change clear change in market condition look at that guys look at that clear change in market condition you broke your line in the sand look at that perfect opportunity there was a target balance other side combined with potential rotational environment here or a change in direction or a change in sort of rhythm um now i'm not saying you know if i'm sitting here obviously it's easy for me to say because i'm fast forwarding it but that doesn't matter the exercise isn't to make money i want you to take trades whatever i'm just trying to show you how you can start to combine these two things obviously i'm combining loads of things together but this is a brilliant brilliant brilliant way to start combining things together so i wouldn't merge any of these two more on the 24th i'm going to speed it up a bit because i've got quite a few days to cover so that's forgive me i might just end up skipping some days because it is taking a while okay so we've got here so clearly these two are going to be merged okay all right look at that guys come on you can't say there aren't some unbelievable trading opportunities here okay you've gone in balance you've gone slow and then you're starting to build here what did i say test it on the second test i would say that the rhythm in my opinion is established so you've tested the 0.5 once come back you test it again turns blue get long no real clear targets because we don't have anything but you know obviously you're going to probably scale there and then you can just kind of hold it and see where it takes you up to you but look at this just just very clear opportunities you know that's what i want you to do just it's not about making money i want you to see how developing value works with static value just keep doing this exercise i would say like literally cover months of data as much as you can master this this is what i say this theme takes months to master you know i did say six seven months before getting on the simulator this is why i want you to get the practice in fine use the simulator i'm showing you and obviously you can press play and whatever and do what you want but same time you need to see as many of these as you can so you get used to combining developing value with static value it's going to be a lot for you so i would suggest just keep doing this for a significant period of time you know look back as many months as you can till you just master this process there's no sort of uh exact number i can give you but obviously i would suggest you do as many as you can i'm not just going to keep skipping forward basically i'm going to try to give you some varied examples let's merge that those two is merging right okay copy and move copy and move there so it's a new day it's going to move this forward okay absolutely you know it should be killing the market on a day like this look at it guys it's just doing what break out of value pull back and pull back and plenty of opportunities right this is classic using developing value area classic classic classic value trading uh sorry not pva what am i doing cva thank you pardon uh combining developing value with static value okay crystal clear right what's your line in the sand two eight seven six what's my hypothesis greater than two eight seven six less than two eight seven six keep it as simple as that guys so above here i want to get long below here i want to get short where are we we're above i want to get long what's the developing market condition at the open what did i say one test second test get in the market slow trend third test if you didn't get in look at that it's just beautiful you know yeah we had some rhythm changes here whatever but the point is you know could have scaled out here and like i said do you remember what i said every time it pulls back and breaks the top you can move your stop here breaks the top move your stop here breaks the top move your stop here breaks the top stop stop and you would have got stopped here what a trade you know the end of the day could have normally i like to scale out at sort of previous areas that we've been to so it could be obviously day high or whatever because obviously a lot of people are watching those areas but i leave that to you there's no right or wrong answer okay if anyone tells you yeah make sure you take two times your risk two to one nonsense guys you know at the end of the day i don't trade like that you're not you need to take profits in areas that seem logical so it could be here doesn't matter even if your stop's here and you're getting three times the reward doesn't matter at the end of the day you gotta learn to trade the market to where the market orders are telling you are logical places and adjust it accordingly right because this whole notion of linear risk taking i tell you it's a marketing scam that's all it is because if they tell you that you're gonna buy the course because then you get this comfort blanket of oh my stop will go here and my take profit will go here and i'm gonna my bank account will go up guys those of you have done those type of courses no it just doesn't work firstly the contextual read is complete rubbish anyway let's be honest it's not based on market data it's all based on squiggly lines and stuff here i'm showing you value trading at an incredibly high institutional level you would not believe this is literally like value area trading at the highest institutional levels all right that doesn't mean you're going to be able to kill the market with it until you've done your thousand hours screen time or whatever but what it does mean is when you're putting that screen time in it's going to be incredibly effective that's all the point is when you're looking at squiggly lines and you're developing screen time you're not learning anything it's hindering you you're wasting time here this way you're seeing obviously value areas on a intra-period basis new investors how are new investors treating fair value that previous investors have established that's the only interaction that's going on in every single marketplace in the world so i'm showing you that so let's just move on okay like i said i'm just going to go really as fast as i can now because let's see is there another i think there was in between it is about that sound okay there you go potential opportunities here but we didn't quite reach the other side right so some potential opportunities some rhythm changes but look you can't argue that there wasn't potentially shorting opportunity in here maybe you would have wanted it to you know just but but look at what the rhythm was that was it really that was the entry wasn't it at the open you'd maybe got a scale and then probably you might have got stopped out you know probably would have got stopped out and it just kind of went sideways and turned to a bit of mush then it pulled out and then yeah there wasn't really anything was there it just really turned so much the rest of the day the point is you kind of can get a feel for what the market is trying to achieve here it's obviously trying to get to the other side we've had a breakout of value bread market do you remember guys right exactly the same thing i described in the other um video just recently one no what was it 150 and it wasn't it was the milk wasn't it was the milk market 150 that's your 160 that's 140 and that's your dollar right look what we did gone in balance yeah it was a mess it's not always going to be the way you want it to of course not you see the market was seeking value low and look what happened didn't even notice that bang guys this is what the market is doing day in day out night in night out this is what the market is doing it's moving from value to value to value okay i do this every single day i mark these areas you've seen it on my chart because i know fine i want help to help me navigate how exactly this market might do this should i get in should i not but ultimately my targets i'm showing you exactly what i'm doing value to value to value to value that's all i'm doing all day long and in fact you can see it here value to value to previous value to previous value to previous value to previous value right so all the market's doing in balance balance balance balance balance it's all it's doing all day long guys you know it's all it's doing we've been through a million times but let's do another million times if we have to just want to make sure everyone gets there um has it decided to freeze up again unfortunately sorry it does happen because i forwarded it a bit too much it needs to just catch up with itself just give it a second if this happens just be patient with it let it catch up with itself there you go it started again i'm just getting a little bit impatient with it okay so let me try doing it this way just speed it up a bit it's because i'm going so fast that's the problem it is causing it a little bit of so you'll have to forgive me yes sometimes what i do is i just play around with this and just add a minute and whatever just helps it unfreeze itself okay there we go 12 hours see just just don't worry it's not that it's not working obviously i'm jumping 12 hours at a time so it's got to reload all that data and work itself out that's all it is it's very normal it's an incredible system that even lets you do all of this guys just look at this i mean this do you see that i'm not necessarily saying there were opportunities here because it was a bit of a slow trend um environment but look what the market was trying to achieve crystal clear very very slow trend don't you want just went from one side to the other side rotation environment and it was this wasn't it and look where it was from days ago it's from like almost two weeks ago this value area that we're trading in between and we're using developing value okay so i am really going to motor ahead now because i think i've pretty much um sort of proved my point and in fact i'm even tempted to end it here but let's just uh look at a couple more right okay okay so always get my copy and don't merge these two and obviously cut this don't forget to obviously cut cut that just delete that because i only need two of them don't i to draw onto the new one move cool right let's delete that one okay so we've got another clear path that's what we're doing we're just creating value to value all the stuff i showed you in auction market theory but this time we've got obviously developing value to help guide us guide us from for that path from how the market is seeking value and the balancing that's all we're doing okay so did we have any opportunities here yeah golden opportunity wasn't it there potentially depending on how you read that you know guys don't expect perfection either you're going to miss the trade fine deal with it come back the next day otherwise you know if you think that that was enough of a test double test here to signify that obviously we tried to go in balance we failed and the rotation kind of failed didn't it and it started to build value in this region i'm not saying that that was enough for me i don't know you need to decide that from doing this keep doing it until you kind of get a feel for it you know it's always going to be slightly different um whether you get in there or not if you don't you don't doesn't matter miss it no big deal look great opportunity here acceptance not enough acceptance there look at the rhythm plenty of opportunities uh what's the it's more of like a somewhat in between isn't it it's either a slow trend or a fast trend either like that but that doesn't really matter does it so there's confluence of obviously a rhythm perfect opportunity get long get a scale out and then probably would have got stopped out there great trading opportunity okay incredibly powerful stuff this um probably i think okay not really much there you can see it literally made the move in one go so apologies if any of this covers my face i haven't marked all the point of controls obviously i want you to mark them um yeah that needs to get rid of that now probably not copy and move very strong area of confluence there and then obviously okay so don't know if you would have actually taken anything here because obviously you've gone so you might have had a trade in there and then had to obviously get stopped or your stop was lower really turned to mush here we're just in a pretty rotational environment but you know the thing is if you think about it there was a trading opportunity because what have we done we've basically gone sort of normal trend imbalance we've broken down you may have if you wanted to take that trade i don't know there's a condition a rhythm change there something changed nothing wrong with taking that absolutely nothing wrong with taking that obviously targeting the other side then we came in and we started rotating and what was the rhythm of this rotation look do you see it's kind of like a it was it wasn't even a one it was more like a sort of 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 and we were accepting within this area so potentially some shorts nothing wrong with that that excellent trade and then going to the other side combining static with developing like i said guys it's never going to be 100 perfect obviously me personally i like to have these lines you don't have to have them as thick as i've got them you can kind of reduce them in a little bit but obviously just made them as quite thick but um i like to have them if you don't want them obviously don't you know it's pros and cons then sometimes you can see it clearer can you see actually you can see it a little bit clearer it's not really up to you what you want to do you can see the acceptance nicely yeah obviously i had my sort of lines i like to give it a little bit of roman do you know what that's how i do it you've seen my charts i do have these areas marked out i do like to just have them marked and then obviously my point of control etc etc i don't really see much yeah nothing really we've already sort of hit target there so you won't want to keep shorting because we've already hit the target um okay i haven't really mentioned this before but i will be honest with you i don't necessarily like to take second standard deviation imbalances because there are extremes right i wouldn't necessarily i don't even really like uh the fast trend that much it's okay it's okay but i'll just be a little bit more cautious that's all i'm saying you know if you're in a quite fast trend obviously that imbalance um you know people are extremely long if things go wrong they're going to bail quite quickly so i would just be a little bit careful you know maybe keep your stock tight or whatever but i typically i don't take these second standard deviations you know i've talked about the probability even though the maths isn't perfect um i've actually been sitting in this chair so long i think it's a good three four hours now that i probably will call it quits if you don't mind because i think we're coming to the end so um yeah i think that's it okay now we're in the live market so look guys i hope that was really useful to you obviously if you've got any questions please let me know just do it using the market replay just literally do like hundreds hundreds of days do both markets make mistakes get confused whatever just keep doing it and eventually keep referring back to this video uh anyway yeah hope it was really useful get that task done start and don't forget do a hypothesis for every single day i want you to write it out draw it out whatever way you want to do it works for you um yeah let me know how it goes thanks

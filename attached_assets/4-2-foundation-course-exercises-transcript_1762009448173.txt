Okay guys so in the last video I came up with a list of exercises that I wanted you to carry out over the next few weeks whilst you familiarize yourself with the depth of market before we actually move on into the pro course and what I thought I'd do is I'd actually split this out into a nice little timetable for you that I think is optimal for you to follow and I'm going to do a series of videos highlighting each thing so this was obviously the slide that I that's a terrible squiggle but it's the slide that I put on the last video where I said look I want you to do this series of steps so what I've decided to do now is actually be a bit more precise with these steps and show you some examples because I think that's going to be the best way to get you on your way and so if I just quickly I've got one more slide in this video and I'm going to move right on to real examples so what I've done is I've split the same bullet points on the previous page into a nice little timetable that I think is optimal for you to follow so for example you might spend you know a week doing part A, a week doing part B, a week doing part C so let's just put here this is just an example obviously if you work or if you have more time on your hands then then the timetable is going to be slightly different so this will be a timetable within the timetable I think in one of the very first modules there's a timetable I wanted you to put together where you would dedicate time to the depth of market, dedicate time to obviously footprint, volume profile and so on and so forth that'll be a several month timetable maybe six, seven, twelve months even this timetable is within the depth of market timetable so for example if you decided right you know what I'm going to put two months aside now where I'm going to focus on understanding what's going on in the depth of market within that two months six to eight weeks for example this is what I want you to do so let's come up with an example timetable together and then I'm going to do videos on each section so this could be say week one to maybe week two or even three because obviously you're just familiarizing yourself for the first time so what I want you to do is this is part A which is going to be so you saw on the previous slide understanding market orders versus pending orders and what I've decided is even though I said to you I don't want you placing any trades because you can do it on the simulator what I think is the best way for you to understand market orders versus pending orders is I'm going to show you so I'm going to do a video showing you how you can actually place orders on the depth of market itself place market orders and place pending orders so you can actually be the aggressor or the person that's sitting on the bid or offer passively it's going to be the best way for you to learn so yeah that comes on to the second part of this same topic which is understanding the difference between you know someone showing aggression on the depth of market and someone still wanting to buy or sell but doing it a little bit more passively so again we'll do this by placing those orders so I'm going to show you in the next video which is going to be video A how to actually place orders on your Sierra chart depth of market and even if you don't use Sierra chart you've got managed to get yourself a depth of market somewhere else should be pretty much the same process so let's aim for at least and I would say minimum once I would say a couple of weeks if you can be doing this particular process that'd be great then let's spend maybe another week so this could be week three just looking at supply side games and consolidating what you've learned in video A so really understanding the aggression versus sitting passively on the bid or offer and then understanding how bids and offers are constantly being manipulated and what effect that might have so put a quick video together for that as well so maybe you can spend a good one to two weeks again doing that again it would depend on your schedule if it takes you longer in my opinion the longer the better I don't necessarily use the depth of market myself very much but again like I said it's going to give you a great grounding then I want you to understand absorption so again so the supply side games is just really by observing it and then with the absorption this won't really make sense now until I show you an example so in video C I want you to really understand what it means to absorb supply and demand won't get into it now but we'll get into it in the video so I want you to spend a good couple of weeks consolidating what you've learned in the first two parts and combining that with the absorption so that could be week five to six and finally I've put together an example where I'm actually bringing everything together so I'm actually going to do a trade on the depth of market and I want you to follow that and that will involve actually placing trades on the simulator so as you can see even though I'm not a big fan of you placing trades on the simulator for quite some time I want you to do this exercise not necessarily with a view to making money I want you to do it with a view to bettering your understanding and I think by placing some simulator trades again without the pressure of I'll have to perform at the end of this process no remember the goal of you placing simulator trades in this section is all about bettering your understanding of what is going on at the core of the market behind the chart so what I'm going to do is I'm going to explain to you the sort of things I'm looking for around the volume profile on a depth of market okay now this is more to do with the style of trading that I used to trade historically in a past life and actually in a lot of professional firms if they're focused heavily on the depth of market then as you see here I've got several exercises I want you to understand aggression supply side games absorption guys this list can be fairly extensive it can also include all the game playing that people play and on the depth of market now I haven't included any of that the reason being because the landscape has changed now and algorithms are generally the most active if not I would say you know a significant proportion of the supply and demand sorry the supply side that you see so the depth so they call it depth of market because it's showing you the depth on the bid and the offer now around I would say sixty seventy eighty percent of that is computers and algorithms they're very fast so in my opinion trading on the depth of market is no longer the most optimal way to trade I actually think the best way to trade is using volume profile and VWAP volume weighted average price and some other techniques on a volume chart and obviously that's much more advanced level which we'll do in the pro course however guys don't underestimate how doing these simple four or five steps over a two three period two three month period six months if you can guys is going to make you phenomenal when you come to trading volume profile on a chart because you're going to understand how this thing builds so I'm going to give you a little glimpse into how I used to trade it on a depth of market I don't necessarily trade it like this anymore I trade very similar to this but I do it on a chart now and I get much better results actually doing it that way but I don't think it would have been possible unless I'd spent so much time doing these elements so you know to summarize I may have been looking at 10 15 20 elements on a depth of market I've picked out the most important four and I want you guys to focus on those because the other 15 16 elements or whatever it was that I used to look at I don't necessarily think they're that important unless you're going to be trading on a depth of market full time and again I don't necessarily want you to do that I don't do it doesn't really make sense for you to do it but let's focus on the four five elements that are really important I'm gonna like I say make you world-class traders when it comes to just looking at the profile and footprint and the VWAP etc etc there'll be a few other things obviously nuances that you'll learn on the way and obviously it's gonna really deepen your understanding of what's going on behind the charts when you're trading using charts so I'm going to show you the things I've historically looked at in the volume profile we can do some example I'm going to take some sim trades myself on the same trial package that you use on Sierra and then finally I haven't actually done this yet because we're in the middle of the obviously norovirus and you know I've taken a step back from the markets just for a few trading sessions but what I'm going to do as soon as I'm back in the market is I'm going to try and show you some depth of market action around some of the levels contextual levels that I look at in the currency market but I'm going to show you that on the depth of market and actually it's very similar to what I'll show you in video d with the example I'm going to show you that on the against the discord levels this is very similar it's showing you how buyers and sellers getting trapped and then obviously I'm taking advantage of that so I'm going to show you that but the reason I'm pretty relaxed about this section it's not urgent is because a so I didn't put the time frame here this guys I want you to be spending a good two three weeks on so you can see this is going to take you to week seven to nine you're already you know two months plus before you even get to this section where you're going to be looking at my discord and looking at the depth of market against it it's going to be a good two months and in my opinion it should be longer it just depends how dedicated you are like I said split the sessions up into 30 minutes I know it's hard to look at a depth of market record it come back to it excuse me and then after the two month period I would say focus on this so that's that's reason a why so a is you know it's going to be a period of time before you can get to this section that's why I'm quite relaxed about putting up videos here and you're even looking at these but there's another big reason b is and essentially that's to do with your understanding so all of essentially all of this I'm sure people aren't going to follow my advice and you know that's obviously up to you but I only want you to do this on 10 year treasuries guys the other markets are way too fast it's going to be very difficult for you to understand any of this stuff on any of the other markets it took me several months of staring at this thing every day for hours on end and doing practice on weekend before I could even move on from the treasuries because the other markets are very fast the other thing you understand especially in recent times is because algorithms are obviously much more prominent the markets are even faster than they used to be so it's going to take you a considerable amount of screen time working on slower not slower but thicker markets and that's what makes them slower ironically more liquid markets i.e the treasuries before you understand this now you know the discord levels I'm doing them on things like the pound right essentially the pound on a depth of market is a very fast so for example absorption I can show you absorption on the treasuries over one price absorption on pound dollar for example may happen over five prices the market is doing the same thing over five prices you can imagine your eye coordination with watching what's going on has got to be incredibly fast anyone can do it you can do it but I'm just saying it's going to take you time to build the skill set to do that so that's why I'm pretty relaxed about this section take your time doing these first three or four skills learn them thoroughly and then once you're comfortable with these and you've done it plenty of times then move on to watching the depth of market in the currencies because you'll be more you'll have adapted obviously to the things you're looking for and you'll be able to see them in a faster action depth of market which is what the pound is going to be like so anyway we'll get on watch the next series of videos like I said try not to watch them all at once you can if you want but really I want you to split them out and make your own timetable over the next you know seven eight nine weeks and then even longer because obviously I want you to also spend good two to three weeks doing this last section you know it's it's fairly conceivable that you could be spending up to three months doing this now you might be thinking three months guys three months is actually on the short end of what I would ideally or a professional firm would have you doing this you know like I said I spent up to a year six nine twelve months even before I even started looking at charts granted they wanted me to be profitable on the depth of market I don't want you to do that I don't necessarily want you making money on the depth of market I just want you to understand the core foundations of what makes the volume profile the VWAP the market what actually makes the market move all of this you're going to get a great understanding depth of market so yeah it can be considerably shorter than what I spent you know one year but three months is still a very short period of time ideally I'd want you doing this for six months if you can great if not that's fine at least do the bare minimum which is 10 to 12 weeks see how you get on if you've got any questions let me know otherwise let's get on with some exciting stuff let's get you actually placing trades on the depth of market guys all right enjoy the section

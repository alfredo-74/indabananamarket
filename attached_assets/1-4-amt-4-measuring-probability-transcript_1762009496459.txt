Hello Traders, welcome to the normal distribution section, unfortunately as you can see, I'm sure you've heard my dog in the background throughout the foundation course and I'm sad to say that during the filming of actually this section, normal distribution section, she passed away, she had to be put down because due to ill health, you can see she was obviously quite an old girl and I mentioned that a few times that whilst in an ideal scenario, I didn't really want to obviously have a dog snoring in the background but obviously she's been very old and not necessarily very poorly but obviously deteriorating throughout the last few months and yeah so unfortunately it got to the stage where whilst I was filming this yesterday, her health had started to really go downhill, she was unable to urinate for about 24 hours so I had to unfortunately take her to the vet and they said you know she's obviously developed certain issues and you know it's beyond the point of being able to do anything for her but the thing is, the funny thing is and I hope you don't mind me spending a few minutes saying this because I'd actually put a bullet point on the next slide that had written dog and it was a prompt because what had happened is because she was deteriorating quite a bit, I mean it wasn't obvious at first, she was just getting very restless and she was very very noisy in the background so obviously I put a note because I didn't want to leave her outside and I wasn't 100% certain what was going on so I started the filming and I'd actually written the bullet point there but it got to the stage as I started filming it that it was obvious to me that she was in a lot of discomfort so I took the decision to obviously take her to the vet and that was it so I thought you know what it would be quite fitting for me to dedicate, initially I thought let me dedicate this section of the course to her, her name was Tiger but and you can see she was obviously grey and getting very old but she was quite fit and strong right to the very end but coming back to the point about dedicating this section to her and then I realised actually she's been one of the core reasons why I've been able to put this together and I don't want to exaggerate that and that may sound completely crazy but it's not, really she's been, I mean there's a bed behind me, you know she's kept me company throughout putting this whole thing together and you can see it's been quite a long course and yeah I'd never realised just how much good it was to have that company because now I'm trying to, initially yesterday I thought you know what I need to be professional and just carry on but yesterday it just was like, I was almost at the point where I thought what's the point, it felt very empty doing this, the rest of, or this section even, it was just a really weird feeling, silent feeling almost, you know and obviously whilst it was an ideal having her in the background sometimes scratching at the door it was really yesterday when I realised how much actually it was great having all of that, it brought character to the course, it kept me, it just felt like I had someone around all the time keeping me company whilst I was ploughing through doing all of this but look at the end of the day I've now had one night to reflect on it and I realised, do you know what, she was happiest when I was talking and I realised this throughout the course and forgive me I won't take more than a couple of minutes to say this but I realised because at any time you know she was obviously making noise I used to put her out and what, when she heard me talking very enthusiastically in the course, like putting this course together, she would come to the door and I think what it was is, I don't think she would have enjoyed me just moping around being silent, I think she really enjoyed hearing me talk and and hearing that voice because she felt that you know my presence was here and I was doing something I was really passionate about and happy I think she could really sense it and that's no exaggeration I really felt that's when she was happy when she was sitting there as you could tell she was very peaceful and went to bed as she made clear to us with her snoring so I genuinely think she wouldn't have wanted me to really mope around for the next week and whatever I think she would have wanted me to be happy and you know this comes to my sort of final point which is that you know dogs are very loyal and unselfish the most incredibly unselfish creatures I think and you know man's best friend all of that is very true and I've realised as well that you know human beings and no offence to anyone but we can all I think we'll all agree human beings can be a little bit selfish in the sense that you know I realised that there's no point me feeling sorry for myself this isn't about me this is more about her and obviously yesterday's decision to let her go was really it was about her to make sure that she wasn't suffering anymore and you know I realised she'll be really she'll be much happier without you know just keeping her going suffering and you know being selfish like that so rather than feel sorry for myself I'm gonna be positive and try my best to really recognise that it was in her best benefit and you know finally just want to say obviously you may be watching this a few years after I finish the filming of this because obviously all the stuff in this course is you know going to be relevant for many years after I put this together but you know as it stands obviously my career has been 16 years and it's amazing for me to reflect and think that she's been here throughout the last 15 of those years so really she's been with me through every relationship the whole of my career there were points when I was working obviously in an institutional environment and I used to work from around 6 in the morning sometimes till 10 at night so you know 16 hour days it wasn't practical for me to have her with me all the time so I would obviously she'd have stints staying with my sister or my parents but in particular the last few years you know she's been literally sitting sleeping behind me throughout all my trading and everything you know it's just um yeah I suppose you know there's two ways to look at it either as a sad thing or it's a it's a great thing that she gave me lots and she contributed massively to this course and obviously she's in a happy place now so then rather than make it about me I think it is really about her and that you know she she's she's happier now she's not suffering and she's not in any discomfort so really yeah thanks you know I appreciate you letting me put this into this section and obviously it was important for me I wanted to say a few words and uh you know dedicate really the whole thing the pro and foundation to her I don't think it would have been possible I mean obviously I would have done it but I don't think um I would have done it with as much vigor and enthusiasm I realize that now and I want to make sure I complete this with the same enthusiasm um you know in her memory so um yeah just want to celebrate her life really and I appreciate you letting me put this in and let's crack on and let's get some um you know real work done and you know I realize I'm a professional I want to do the job properly um you know that's the right thing to do so yeah appreciate it let's move on to the next slide okay traders let's get down to business so um what's the purpose of this particular section as we've said several times in all the previous sections and we've been working towards is to um find a way that we can measure value where the bulk of transactions um fits in and we're going to talk about that in a second but what will be very useful is for us to look at the transition that we've been through from the transition course right up until now and remind ourselves of exactly how we ended up at this stage which I introduced in the last section balance imbalance and I showed you how I scrunch up the volume profile and um what it is I don't want people to because going forward basically that's it we're done with all of this we're now going to be looking volume profile um and I introduced market profile but we'll talk about that in a particular section we're going to be looking at profile exactly like this and I don't want people to a treat that as an indicator because it isn't and b I want people to not think oh is something new and get worried and if you've done all the depth of market stuff I've asked you to do you should basically just be a natural should feel very natural to be looking at this because it's what you've been looking at for three months and that's the point so that's what I wanted to just sort of show that transition um just in case there was any confusion um so let's start banana market we had a look at in the foundation example right and we said that essentially banana market was having transactions taking place around a sort of central value and every time do you remember the market got overextended people got trapped and we came back and when it went overextended to the downside again people um got trapped in the sense that they had oversold got too excited and obviously some of those positions had to be unwound and where did we come back to we came back to fair value and um you know we didn't talk about in the level of detail that I've talked about in the pro course but I hope you can see now in hindsight looking back at it that um essentially we were just coming back to some sort of central value and that's really important we're going to talk about this um sort of central tendency um that markets have and I'm going to show you how um that's actually quite useful for us to find probability distribution one particular type of probability distribution that fits that very well but don't worry it's not going to get very mathematical and I'll talk a little bit about that in the next slide but again I just wanted to remind you what all we did in the foundation section was we looked at market orders in the banana market actual physical aggression taking place and you know that was the volume profile so look I don't want to obviously go into it unnecessarily it should be pretty obvious to you what happened there and then I transitioned you over onto the depth of market and um we had market orders taking place this time purely on a financial market but as you saw it's the same thing right all that was happening is market orders were taking place at particular price levels just to squeeze everything in I don't obviously don't have all four columns but you know you're going to be familiar with bids market orders and then the supply side offers which I'm not showing all of that here but as you know market orders every time a market order took place at a price level it got recorded as a transaction no different to what was going on in the banana market and you know you started off on treasuries and if you had a chance you may have seen that exact same thing is happening on s&p 500 pound dollar euro dollar and then all I did is I squeezed the profile didn't I so it is exactly this this this this or even this is this isn't it and it was squeezed as I showed you in the balance imbalance section and um obviously what we're trying to do now is just find some sort of area where we can say do you know what the majority of transactions took place here because you can see it yourself there's too many transactions taking place here for us to realistically as I've been through really to death um you know in great detail although obviously if anyone doesn't get it I'm happy for them to reach out to me but um you know the majority should have realized by now that what I was saying about the webcam example and businesses having the opportunity to be very precise with price over a day two days one week because of this stickiness just doesn't exist in financial markets I mean you can see how many transactions are taking place thousands upon thousands of transactions are taking place at so many different price points it's difficult for us to be precise so we're trying to almost equate that one price into just be a bit more fluid and give it some sort of leeway and say you know what roughly price transacted within this area now I don't know if some of you have noticed this those of you that were quite eagle-eyed and even if you haven't it's okay that's the whole point why I wanted to do this slide quickly is if you noticed um when I was trading especially some of the more thinner markets if you saw I was trading the depth of market of pound dollar in the example I believe somewhere in towards the end of module four and you saw me trading the pound dollar and you may have noticed this yourself as well have you noticed how on US treasuries there tends to be quite a balanced profile and that's obviously to do with liquidity and there's plenty of liquidity going around so it's very easy for the market to relatively speaking easy for the market to do what go through this process of finding fair value because there's so many participants it has plenty of transactions to sort of find its way towards where fair value is going to be but as you notice the more illiquid it gets you may have noticed this that there was you know there were little pockets of value weren't there because the profile was that much more spread out and you know that kind of makes sense you know euro dollar here you can see it's very thin we've almost got several profiles there is a point why I'm mentioning this even the S&P here you see you know there's a little tiny bit of um balancing going on in that pocket there's some balancing going on here there's a little bit here there's some here and you noticed do you remember I was taking trades almost keying off sort of if the market got aggressive through here came back then I'd be going that way or if it sort of failed to really get up there and then came back I'd be keying off that level and bringing it back into this value using this value or you know you could potentially use this value to sort of key off and bring it back that all these little pockets of value and can you see that essentially you may not have noticed this but this is one of the reasons that I scrunched it up you know as I've got on in my career because I recognized that all that was happening if you if you look at what I pointed out here like this little value here this little value here which is what I was doing in that pound example in particular and then there's a little bit here look it's exactly the same here can you see it there's a little bit there there's that little bit there there's a little bit here this is what you're doing on the depth of market and then there's not much volume here so the price would go straight through because there's not many people to obviously transact or interest go straight through and then it will obviously settle in this area then you've got a little bit here and so on and so forth and the problem is when you're stuck on such a small or microscopic basis can you see you can have value everywhere you can have value here you can have value here you can have value here you know value here by scrunching it up what is it allowing us to do this same process but look overall that's all I'm doing it's just allowing me to look at value over the whole day and where fair values for the whole day rather than just for an hour or two hours at a time so I'm really taking a bird's eye view but the point is that I'm doing it what on the same market so rather than looking at these little little pockets I've just decided that rather than you know just to reiterate the point rather than looking that the same way I was looking at you know in the treasury market little pockets of value here what I'm actually doing is I'm saying do you know what rather than being so focused on microscopic values I'm going to actually look at value like that and what that allows me to do is obviously get a better sort of sense where the market is what the market is trying to achieve over the whole day over the whole week over two three days over a month and we're going to talk a lot more about this when we actually get to building trading strategy because you're going to see that different investors have different time horizons yeah it's all well and good being a trader on the depth of market but that's really just looking at where short-term institutional traders are looking algorithms are trading it's not looking at where obviously more of the medium-term traders are looking and we're going to get into that I'm hesitant to mention you know all the names of things like different types of hedge fund strategies that institutions are employing or real money funds pension funds some of the more longer term time frame investors and we'll look at that but obviously to do that you have to start to look at fair value over longer periods of time and that doesn't mean we're not using the depth of market all it means is we're not we're just not being so microscopic about it we're actually getting off the depth of market but scrunching it up so in a way we're really staying on it but we're just looking at it from much more of a bird's eye perspective so I just wanted to make that clear because going forward I'm only going to be looking at profile from sort of this level upwards I'm no longer going to be looking at microscopic profile which is what you've been so used to doing now for two three months and what it is is because I'm making the transition there I just wanted to make sure that you understood look we're not really changing anything all we're doing is we're just rather than drilling down we're doing the opposite we're basically now looking at a much more bigger perspective so we can because in fact I know I've said it already once but I just want to reiterate it because it is important we're not you know if you think about it when you're watching the depth of market you're really seeing what's price trying to achieve from you know almost say if it's out of balance back into balance you're talking about what really a few ticks you know as you saw with the treasury market well if that was this balance area and we were you know trying to get out and unable to because we saw what absorption and aggression coming back in what's the market trying to achieve well it's just moving a few ticks back in this is we're doing the same process now but we're doing it over the entire market and that's going to allow us to transition onto charts and really understanding what is the whole investment community as a whole trying to achieve we can't do that on a depth of market I hope that's clear to you and why it's really important that you now shift your perspective and we start to look at volume profile from a much sort of bigger perspective and we still recognize and respect that all of this is going on but rather than our pure focus being on this we now you know how you saw me do the triangle this essentially forms the five percent you know the order flow the fine tuning the um sort of microscopic detail as I've said several times so that doesn't mean it's not important because at the end of the day you know we've said it before but if you want to think of a real world example if you think of Tesco yeah at the end of the month they might say you know what we sold a million loaves of bread but at the end of the day it still matters that individual people like we're seeing individual transaction here how did that million get formed there were individual people going to individual stores doing individual transactions now imagine someone never told you about that you can't just take this big number a million at the end of the month and just work with it because you wouldn't know how was that million actually built up that's why I had to get you on the depth of market I hope you can see because if I just said to you oh this is a volume profile just believe me guys this is market orders not going to make sense to you unless you've actually seen it can you see how powerful it is to have actually spent time in the depth of market because now you're going to understand this you're going to see this building throughout the day you're going to get it you're going to know ah I see what people are doing they're basically when they're here they're either going in balanced or if they fail and they come back in ah get it now they're going back into balance you've seen it on the depth of market from microscopic perspective it's exactly the same thing but obviously this is going to allow us not have to sit there stare at these numbers up and down all day and also do you know what one thing I haven't mentioned absolutely crucial and you may have picked up on it you've got to remember guys that and this is something that I never really fully appreciated until obviously I became a much better trader um and this was you know it's natural obviously throughout time you you pick things up and you get better as time goes on and one thing that did occur to me is that look if you think about it even if there's some guy who's got some flow he's got some orders to fill because he's got an investment horizon of three days one week whatever it is at the end of the day isn't that going to have an impact on the market even from a short-term perspective of course it is let's say you're sitting here you're staring at your depth of market the price is you know you're looking at this little pocket of value and the price is uh somewhere in this region and you see huge absorption coming in and you see aggression coming in what if you could know that actually hang on a minute there's you know this bigger sort of value there's some guy who's actually likely to come in at um this area because he's got a big order to fill because he's taking a position for a longer perspective can you see that's going to impact this area if you're solely focused on just looking at what's going on here you're not going to see what the guys are doing up above you you know and that type of order flow is significant and it can move the market significantly more than obviously a small algo playing a few ticks so that's the reason i'm going to move us away from that and really get us to start looking at value from obviously a bigger perspective and just finally to say that you know to reiterate obviously we need to define what that value is that's what we're going to move on to the next slide and yeah we're just going to look at value from sorry profile from this perspective and larger now so don't get you know like i said too confused you shouldn't be you should really just understand that it's just what we've been doing all along but obviously we've just scrunched it up so we can start to figure out what the market's trying to achieve over the whole day and a bit further so we can start holding positions and we can be a bit more relaxed and have a bit more of a feel for what the whole market is trying to achieve so let's go on to the next slide okay ladies and gentlemen so what we're doing on this slide is i don't really get too worried about all these mathematical formula you see here i will discuss them but in no way are we gonna you know i'm not expecting you to know what any of this is in fact the opposite and i'll come on to that in a moment what i want to do is i just want to i think it'll be quite useful for us to do a very quick recap of what we were looking at in the prior section which is that you know if you remember this was essentially the volume profile for the day in the evening s&p and you know these were just profiles obviously of prior days so you can imagine why i'm doing this again because if i was on that little depth of market that you see with all the tiny incremental values how on earth am i going to know what investors are trying to achieve over a few days it's impossible right this is where you're really going to take your trading to the next level because you're going to have a brilliant understanding now of what investors on all different time horizons are going to do and we're going to build that up for you but firstly we need to measure this this thing we've been talking about for a while now about value value areas so you can see it here you know typically it's kind of obvious when you eyeball it that the majority of transactions took place in these little buckets almost and we need to define those buckets because at the end of the day we want to be able to compare them day to day so i'm going to show you how institutions are doing that they're just saying look do you know what that's what value is and this is called actually a value area high and a value area low and i'm going to talk about that quite a bit a value area high value area low and institutions are using these areas to determine whether the market is balanced or you know if it breaks out and it goes up it's imbalanced and then you're getting into the next area of balance and we've talked about this quite a lot what imbalance means in that obviously it's aggression you know more aggression on one side of market orders more buyers than sellers but in aggressive terms not outright terms as we've said many times because buyers and sellers are always going to be equal it's the aggression the market orders coming in and obviously there could be some fundamental reasons behind it but as i said in my opinion that's all sort of factored in already but the point is is this that we a are going to find this to measure a measurement for how we can define these levels but also i just wanted to make one point as well you know um and i know i'm always i say i always apologize i don't know why i'm apologizing i shouldn't it's not my fault that you know the forex industry has created all this um garbage around um you know retail terms like trending and the reason i said trending is because have you noticed guys the market never trends it doesn't actually trend there's no such thing as trending all the market is doing is imbalancing trying to seek what value what is the marketplace it's trying to match buyers and sellers at this stage aggressive buyers and sellers at this stage there's no sort of um match is there where aggressive buying is being countered by aggressive selling i.e sellers are aggressively have if a seller is aggressive he's more happy than someone who's passive right that means he's very happy to sell a balanced market as you know will have aggressive buyers and sellers how do we know that market orders what happens in this space if market orders are taking place in both ways profile builds heavily doesn't it what happens in imbalance there is where there aren't aggressive buyers and sellers there's nothing it's very thin there's no transactions taking place it's all aggressive buying aggressive buying aggressive buying and there's no aggressive selling to meet it so that's what happens when markets when people see basically all the markets doing is as i've showed you many times is it's happy transacting whatever and then boom it goes up imbalances people call this trendy it's not okay seeking value it's looking for areas where where can i find transactions to take place okay it's really crucial you understand that that the market never trends it's just constantly seeking value seeking areas of value and your job as a trader i'm going to talk about this a lot later is to find out where do people in different investment horizons and classes perceive value to be and it is a very very hard job to do i'm not going to lie to you but obviously with the correct tools at least you can have a good chance of being able to do that and we're going to talk a lot more about that and look i know i've gone a little bit off topic here but it's really important because i'm trying to lay some seeds in your mind i don't want to just throw this at you all of a sudden a few sections time and you're like whoa that's a lot for me to take in what i'm trying to do is subtly lay these seeds in your minds you're already starting to think about them and what will happen is you'll see at the end of the day what you probably haven't realized you may have is have you noticed how this is one two three four five six trading sessions say about a week right just over a week this is actually a depth of market but broken out so in theory think about it you could have and sierra chart and all institutional platforms let you do this i don't necessarily do it um on five day or sorry a six day basis i do look at it for a week but we'll get into that i just don't want to confuse you right now is that what you could in theory do is you could join if you think about it if you move this profile right to the edge of the screen you move this one in you move that one in you move that one in you move that one in what would happen you'd have that and that kind of merged up here wouldn't you so you'd have a bit of a bulge there then there's not much volume here so it'd be thin then you merge these two together a bit of this and a bit of that and you'd have a big bulge here because you'd have all this volume right then you'd have very little volume in this space this space this space so go in again then you'd have a bulge again because what you've moved this area into here okay and then you'll have a very thin profile because there's no volume here so can you see that is a volume profile but all you've done is you've just broken it out into little pieces can you see that it's almost like um let me see here i think this should work yeah can you see it's almost similar to obviously this is this is actually a day period but imagine that was a whole week all you've done is you've just said all right you know what i'm gonna break that out i'm gonna take that i'm gonna break that out taking this i'm gonna break that out okay that is that is basically what you've got here is you've got a depth of market from your page for a whole week it's just broken out can you see the type of analysis you can do with this is amazing honestly i'm really it still excites me to this day i mean obviously as i said i was a depth of market trader i didn't really start looking at profile until a little bit later on into my career which was around that sort of six to eight year period which i've mentioned in the reality check video i believe so you know i've been obviously in the business 16 years so it's only been about eight years eight years eight to ten years a little under 10 about eight years that i've been um looking at this type of analysis you know really um getting off the depth of market and looking at this and it still excites me to this day how amazing it is the sort of things you can work out about what investors are trying to achieve by really breaking profiles out over longer periods of time and uh understanding and seeing actually do you know what everything that was going on in my depth of market it's actually happening here it's happening here i mean if i hadn't told you that this was friday this was monday this was tuesday this was wednesday and this was thursday for all you know this is a day profile for all you know that could have been an hour out of this day profile this could have been another hour this could have been an hour this could have been an hour here this could have been an hour a few hours or whatever this could have been a few hours that made up this entire you know chunked out chunked out chunks out here that just made up this day and that's your day broken out right how do you know that it's a week it's only because you can see it here can you see that you can really start to do amazing things if you broaden your horizons and just apply the same analysis you've been doing on the depth of market but rather than being so microscopic and looking at the minutiae start to really understand that you know what people are trying to achieve fair value over longer periods of time and um as you know it's a little bit this is the final point i'm going to make here before we actually define this um this area that we want to call fair value is this is what's actually unique and again i'm just laying the seed don't think i'm talking for the sake of it i apologize that this has gone on a little while but it's important i mentioned this the difficulty is um and i've noticed a lot of people do find this hard to accept i think they get it but they don't want to accept it is that generally um in a consumer market like bread milk chocolate eggs whatever you have would you agree people are buying bread or buying eggs or buying milk um they're not looking to sell that in a year's time or in six months time or in one month's time so one is purchase and then you consume it as consumers the problem in financial markets is the beauty of it but the problem from a speculative perspective is that think about it when you buy the pound or you buy the stock market index or when you buy a commodity as a speculator does every single person view it the way that they view bread you know you everyone buys bread and they eat it it's done that's it why do you think it's so easy for bread price to kind of be sticky it's about a pound everyone will kind of agree on it the whole world or at least your uh general local market you know like your country or whatever doesn't work like that in financial markets does it that's the problem there's different people some people called locals which we're going to talk about who are proprietary trading firms short-term algorithms they're not interested in holding this thing for a week but then you'll have medium-term investors certain um types of hedge fund styles that obviously want to do what take risk into a weak risk they want to take it for a week right i mean if you've got an algorithm that's trading on the depth of market it's interested in a few ticks who on earth is going to hold the market for a week for a few ticks obviously they're looking for bigger moves then you've got pension funds who are holding for months right you've got central banks you've got um obviously different types of institutions that are looking to play longer term they might be looking for 500 ticks can you see their perception of value is going to be very different um again i know i'm going off topic here but i hope you can understand it's important you start to at least start to think about this and because i am going to introduce it as well so you know um we talked about this before being potentially the profile for the whole week if we were to merge all of these together and scrunch them up into this side um do you see someone with a longer term perspective for a week his perception of value might be this whole area and he might be the market might be down here and he might be thinking do you know what i'm seeing aggression i'm seeing absorption or whatever it is he's seeing seeing some supportive fundamental factors and he's thinking do you know what i think there's a good chance i'm going to get back into fair value for the whole week and therefore i'm gonna play this to get back into that area right very different to a algorithm who's looking at that area there as you saw me do on the pound dollar but in theory it's the same thing it's just over a wider horizon but see this is the difficulty in financial markets is this order flow is going to impact that order flow and then there might be some medium term guy um over here who's looking at these two buckets of value and the market's you know um over here obviously it's not it's over here at the time but you know something's happening over here which makes him think it's going to be imbalanced or whatever now um obviously this doesn't align but you understand my point this order flow is going to impact this order flow is going to impact this these order flows are all impacting each other and i'm going to show you how to navigate this but this is the beauty of um profile and starting to look at it from a bird's eye perspective so um i've realized i've basically completely gone off topic there but it was important i did that because i want you to understand um why we've moved away i really because i'm what i've noticed is especially feedback from the foundation courses a lot of people um and look it's a good thing i really love the enthusiasm but got to be careful that you don't become obsessed with the depth of market and becoming profitable on there because i'm going to show you why you're not going to do it you know the way the algorithms are these days and i'm going to show you actually some institutional guys trading on a depth of market later as well because i want to show you other institutional guys as well not only me it's quite nice for me to show you other guys and i'm going to show you how algorithms have really changed now and it's very very difficult this on the other hand is something where you know human beings can really add edge because it's very difficult to trade an algorithm on this type of analysis where we can actually start to look at value here we can look at obviously what locals are doing we can also look at day the intraday value there we can look at value over two three days that type of investor as i said we can look at the bigger term we can start to put all these things together and really use our discretion and as i said what you get paid to really think outside the box and that's what we can do so anyway i hope you can see that that was actually done for a logical reason that i wanted to go through that and what we're going to do now is we're actually going to look at how value is measured so let's look at it from a sort of probability distribution perspective so i'm just going to talk you through this slide so we've done the recap and a little bit more i went on a little bit of a tangent but i was very relative like i said i want you to start becoming comfortable with this type of profile no longer obviously being so focused on the minutiae you know obviously the dog thing i discussed with you and told you why there was a bullet point there so really i want to start to talk a little bit about this probability distribution so as i said this is no longer relevant to us we've now transitioned into profile on a sort of wider basis and what essentially i've done is so we've got the profile going from top to bottom right but all i've done is i've just flipped it okay so again don't think i is doing something different i'm not the reason i flipped it is because of this so what this is is it's called a bell curve distribution and firstly i want to be quite clear and tell you that i've mentioned to you when you go into a professional firm or i would what i actually said to you at the start was that i would be very clear when you go into a professional firm what they're going to teach you and what they're not this they're not going to teach you i can be absolutely say that with 100 certainty they don't teach you about normal distribution they expect you to know it not to any level of detail but they'll and i think it's a mistake and i'll show you why because i think it's actually quite useful for you to know because i've seen it time and time again people just use this stuff as almost indicator like and it's not that you've got to understand the limitations you've got to understand um you know the measurements that so this this sort of area of value right the balance area that we define you need to know how that's formed to some extent you know i don't want you to just take my word for it at the end of the day probably makes more sense what i'm what i'm trying to get at if we answer this question is maths important because i know there's going to be some of you who have never heard of a normal distribution and maybe you know very little about statistical mathematics and i've got good news for you you're at an advantage and you won't even believe me i know you'll be thinking now you're just having us on you're just saying that to make us feel better and actually i don't need to do that you've already bought the course you know you haven't asked me this question before purchasing the course like i envy do i need to know maths and i'm just telling you this so you know i'm a i'm a very honest person as you know i'm very blunt um i tell it how it is and you know so there's no reason for me to uh mislead you i'm telling you frankly very genuinely that you have a major advantage um if you've heard down very little maths before and that's going to be music to your ears and that's good now i've put here is maths important it depends now there's a what it is is i said i'm going to be honest with you i've noticed in uh social media circles there seems to be i mean it's irresponsible anyway shouldn't be trading things like gold and because it's a very thin profile and you know um i'm going to get into that later and foreign exchange is obviously one of those markets as well i'm sorry to say but no professional firm is going to let you trade those markets because they understand how thin the volume is and how difficult it is for the market to you know how i said before in treasuries you've noticed it the profile builds very nicely why because it's very liquid there's people there there's a lot of volume the process as i said before price determination is happening very quickly because buyers and sellers are in abundance effects just not the case guys it's a grey market you have to understand that it's thin why do you think in pound dollar i was struggling do you remember i was like oh there's a bit of value here there's a bit of value here there's a bit of value here and a bit of value here in treasury it's like gollops all that up and it's just nice and smooth it's all over the place in effect right so that's that's um one thing but that's not the point point coming back to mathematics is that i've noticed people are very irresponsible um they'll be pushing options towards you i've noticed this big trend of people wanting to get into options complete and utter bonkers absolute bonkers the end of the day you've got to realize the value of an option is driven by time decay by volatility you know to measure these things um people may not want to accept this but yeah you need to understand what on earth is going on in the mathematics of all of that because you know you may not know this and this isn't for my ego boost but um it's because i want to bring things to life and tell you that i actually experienced this myself so at the start of my career a little stint on the options desk i worked on an options desk and i used to um build incredibly complex pricing models on spreadsheets and uh using uh quite complicated mathematics so there was a time when i could read what you see here it's like english to me it's very straightforward because this is what i studied i was a mathematician um at business school and you know i did i built quite heavy um financial models um which is probably why i got into investment banking uh fairly easily but you might be thinking oh who does he think he is um it's not that actually what i want the reason i'm telling all this because it's worked to my disadvantage massively because for options structured products i'm going to tell you bluntly if you don't know um you know decent level of maths and statistics forget it you shouldn't be touching those markets but guys these are vanilla products these are not driven by um all these different variables like i talked about time decay volatility even volatility of volatility you need to understand quite a lot of things to trade um options in a certain way it's very important you understand that but markets um like the spot market futures market nope they're called vanilla markets they're driven by what transactions um human beings it's a it's a very emotional field it's you know maths is not involved at all and in fact to make my point um because it's an important point let's be honest to to put people at ease they need to know this up front hang on what am i getting myself into should i go and learn all this stuff no because and i'm going to show you why what are we trying to do right we're trying to say that okay let's try and find out where balance is in this market based on transactions that have taken place throughout the day guys we've got to realize is that um the market's very imperfect so what could have happened here on this particular day no two days are exactly the same this market could have done this do you see it could have gone like that it could have gone like that and then it could have gone like that and then it could have had these sort of emotional spikes all over the place so do you see these even when you're using maths to define these values um in certain instruments like i said more illiquid instruments where you've got more sophisticated players and it's purely institutional which is typically tends to be the case in things like structured products and options and so on and so forth it isn't such a broad market so some of those mathematical factors are much more important but here guys honestly i can tell you whether you mark your value area high here or whether you mark it here i can honestly and i don't like to use these type of phrases but it's true the market doesn't give a monkeys i can tell you without any hesitation that anywhere in this region is going to be okay i tell you from experience having been a maths junkie myself i used to find it so difficult to accept that the mathematical answer is this line but oh no actually the market did what can you see it decided to turn around a little bit above where i thought my exact line should be so let me just um again it is important i do this for especially those of us um that are kind of a bit concerned about what i've been showing in terms of mathematics so what it is is so in a balanced market right guys sometimes the market's going to turn around here okay it's going to go up sometimes it's going to do this and then it's going to go up back into balance sometimes it's going to go a little bit further and go can you see it could be anywhere in this region okay but then why do we use a model because at the end of the day i don't want to be drawing it over here okay that's just ludicrous i don't want to be drawing it right at the edge that's just ridiculous don't want to be drawing it over here you know i want to get some sort of semblance of standardized value that i can use to just compare across um and essentially that by looking at probability distribution and it'll make sense in a second we can get a very approximate idea and like i said the guys who have probably have never heard of a normal distribution before guys i assure you're going to be a massive advantage um so please don't go out and you know go and spend the next year of your life trying to learn maths you're wasting your time you're going to go backwards because you're going to make the mistake and i suffered big time you know i told you i had this two-year period where i was a bit stagnant and i know i've mentioned other reasons but you've got to you know i've said it before financial market is fast and there's a plethora of reasons and actually this was an another major reason do you remember i told you that i was i found it difficult to allow the market this sort of leeway to be very fluid and precision kills people i saw it so many times financial whiz kids coming in thinking they could trade the sp500 or um you know they like me they'd come from a technical background they got crushed why is that because you're trying to accept it if the market had a little bit of a um you know bad moment and then came back in they would say nope that is imbalanced i know because my mathematical formula tells me it has to be here okay problem is the market doesn't kill monkeys like i said it's not perfect i'm going to show you that in a moment um it could just as easily be that fair values in this region and so i kind of learn to you know what let me read the volume in the moment dynamically and this is where i i'm going to give a reality check later than uh you know people find it's very hard to accept that there is no magic tool or indicator and this in a nutshell is why the market's very imperfect it's not going to be precise you have to be very good at recognizing the market's doing this um and that's why i had you on the depth of market obviously to build up some sort of understanding of absorption and things like that i'll show you how you can start to read some of that without looking at the depth of market you know cumulative delta there'll be certain tools we can use um footprint to an extent and as well but um there'll be ways you know we can help to kind of um identify that potentially it's it's it's not actually gonna go imbalanced it's actually even though it's broken out of this sort of uh area that we call value area low value area high um actually it's kind of just faked not faked but you know it's just overshot slightly and obviously these are things you have to learn to read in the moment and the problem is if you have this mathematical mindset that everything has to be precise you're finished i'll tell you right now you're gonna have big problems because i can assure you the market will not stop at that exact line that we're about to define using a probability distribution model um it's going to be imprecise so you know that's why i say hope it's clear if you're basically if you kind of just get the gist of it massive advantage because you're not going to approach it in that um precise sense and i know i keep saying this because obviously i hope you appreciate i don't have instant feedback and i just want to make sure everyone gets it that's why sometimes i do repeat myself a few times but in a nutshell basically as long as you come away from this knowing that you know what 70 of values constitutes the majority it's as simple as that you'll be okay and then i'm just going to basically show you some basic stuff like the mean um the mode which is literally just and you see in green here it's just the area where the highest number of transactions took place and the mean everyone knows what the average is and if you can just accept that you know what when the bulk of transactions this the sort of bracket where the bulk of 70 percent of the bulk of transactions fit in is my value area i.e 70 percent of transactions is this many you know these are market orders right just scrunched up 70 percent fit in here that's my value area but i've got to do this section because at the end of the day if i just tell you that you know i don't want you to just say do you know what envy told me it was 70 percent so i'm going to use no no no no no no no no we don't we don't do that i've always said to you um anytime someone told me something even my boss no i don't accept it you've got to you've got to have at least to some extent you've got to understand why is it 70 percent um but at the end of it my point is going forward as long as you kind of just say do you know what 70 percent yeah i'm okay with that you're going to be a massive advantage to the other person who says no it's got to be this particular level because the probability distribution says it has to be 68.8 percent no you're going to be in big trouble doing that so let's get on and actually look at normal distributions which is the type of probability distribution and then we can um sort of get you to see why i talked about this 70 percent okay so um it's the final bit i just want to say on this slide before we look at a real example is that so this is something called a normal distribution okay and it's very very very simple you don't please don't look at this and think oh my god i'm never going to get this all these percentages some of you will be familiar with this you'll know that standard deviations uh one two standard deviations um from from obviously the the sort of mode um or the mean which in a normal distribution they're equal obviously um but if that makes no sense i'm going to go over that in a moment what it is is um the reason that we use normal distributions is because we're going to go over this in the next slide but just notice one thing that markets in a balanced environment behave exactly like a statistical normal distribution and i know you're sitting there thinking what on earth is a statistical normal distribution not all of you but those of you are not familiar with it so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to go on the next slide um and we're going to discuss it and this don't worry about it too much all this is is it's just um showing us why in this type of environment which is actually applicable to many scenarios in real life doctors are using normal distributions for clinical trials governments are using them to forecast certain characteristics about the population because obviously they can't um ask every single person a question if they want to find out certain characteristics about the population that live in the country and so on and so forth so they use samples and then they will try to figure out you know what's the likelihood that certain percentage fits into um a range and that's essentially all we're trying to do is we're trying to find out what range does the majority i.e this 70 percent i talk about fit into some sort of range so what we're going to do next is i'm going to come back to this is um essentially we're going to talk a little bit about the normal distribution and what is a normal distribution um and in fact um why don't i just quickly kick that off here and then we can go to the next slide because it's quite uh i'm thinking do you know what um i don't want anyone to be left at the end of this slide um with any sort of feeling of dread in their mind that um you know i'm never going to get this if you think of um you've actually looked at a normal distribution if you've done the foundation and followed some of the modules without probably realizing it do you remember we had the example where i said that and we were looking at milk and um we had the milk price at one dot uh sorry 150 wasn't it um we had it at 150 and do you remember i said to you that oh if you go um you know and take a survey outside of the high street and everyone coming up to you um gives you a price well that it's almost like doing a tally okay one two three four five at a price that's all you were doing guys that is exactly what a normal distribution is it's all it's doing is it's basically sorting data into something called a histogram which is that if you've got your $1.50 for milk and i said to you what every time someone buys so this is just quantity here and every time someone buys at 150 just record it like that what would you do you'd be recording recording recording because everyone's going to be buying at this kind of central price very close to 150 right you're going to have someone buying it at zero um or 10p or 20p very unless they're very lucky and they get like some sort of bargain you're going to get the odd person but the closer you get to the sort of general price of milk the more transaction is going to take place and you're going to be recording these by hand right all the normal distribution is doing is it's taking a line of best fit and saying that's it do you see that look can you see the shape okay so that's i thought you know what let me just show you that quickly so you see very simple it's just literally a record of data a tally at every single price point and i want you to recognize this what is going on and you know the reason i showed you this as well is because i realized it's probably quite good for me to show you this whilst i've got the old depth of market because you can't see that level of detail here and you wouldn't be able to see this look instead of 150 what is it it's just a price and what's that quantity it's exactly the same thing can you see the market's doing that right at every price you're just recording and instead of you recording on a piece of paper the exchange is doing it for you the exchange is saying oh one contract at three that could be 150 right and one transaction of milk took place so just be one contract market order instead it's just a financial market price just a price at the end of the day same thing's happening and we're looking at a best fit and it just so happens and i'm going to explain this later on that so you agree this depth of market is that and it's just that flipped over that the behavior of financial markets in a balanced environment is what majority of transactions take place in the center in the center milk what does it do bread all these products they don't fluctuate um in the sense that they may but at the sort of more extreme levels these areas very little transactions take place and in the meat the middle the main price lots of transactions take place so what mathematicians have realized is that you know things that have a sort of tendency to have this sort of central value which is pretty so many things as you know pretty much every product you see on the supermarket shelf is approximately the same price all over the country right okay 5p 10p here and there but what's the financial market doing is it when a financial market is moving time and price does it do that no of course not it gyrates a little bit 5p 10p here and there in the same way a price of the good does the market's doing that as well it's exactly the same so that's why you know you might get the odd blip up there you might get the odd blip down here but that's going to have very little tally numbers contracts volume whereas here you're going to get tons like you got here at 150 tons tons very little here what's that doing forming a distribution in this shape and what it is is they just notice mathematicians that any um sort of um sample or population that has outcomes that tend to congregate around a central value and there's loads of things i'm going to show you well what they've noticed is mathematically within one standard deviation which is um it's a measure of dispersion or or sort of how much price it varies from the mean in terms of all the values it's going to make sense in the next slide we can standardize that and say across all of these financial markets milk bread heights of children shoe sizes whatever within a one standard deviation range either side 68 34 plus 34 68 percent i.e the majority of values will fall within that range so can you see why i talked about that 70 now okay even market professionals just say you know what let's just round it up 70 because they've recognized the market's imperfect um let's just use that sort of standard deviation range um as 70 rather than 68 but what i want to do is so understand that may still not have been clear to a lot of people to some of you who've looked at normal distribution it would have why don't we go and see how normal distribution works in real life again i'm not saying this because for an ego reason but i want you to know that you will not see this in a proprietary trading environment in a professional training then i'm going to teach you this i'm doing this because a i really feel strongly that i want to bridge the gap i've promised to bridge the gap between retail and professional and i'm going to do that i want to do more i want to do more than that and i want to show you some of the pitfalls that people can fall into a because this isn't explained to them properly but b even if they come from a background where they know this inside out they go to the other extreme where they try to be too precise with all of this just get the gist of it and you're gonna be laughing um and you know don't worry too much about all of this you don't need to know all this is telling us is um why within one standard deviation is 34.1 and 34 honestly who cares like i said i used to be obsessed and i used to feel so good about myself that yeah i know all of this and when it came to trading the markets oh my god i was i was in a disaster but as i said i did did stagnate you know and there were guys around me so much better who didn't have this mathematical background and used to drive me bananas and then i realized why because they were much more flexible all right they accepted it i found that hard to accept um that markets are imprecise so you know get all this stuff out of your head don't worry about it it's really not going to do any favors get the gist of it let's go on to the next slide and look at it in a real world example cheers okay ladies and gentlemen so just to reiterate the point what i've done here is i've put together a quick summary of some of the things that we've talked about and you know what you need to come away with and why it's actually really not that complicated but the reason i talk about in depth is because i like to do a good job and just make sure that i've covered all the basis um and you know i said it before it's better i say more and do some people's heads in by talking so much rather than not say enough and leave people confused so you know i'd rather say too much than too little so um essentially that's why i'm going over this in so much detail even though as you'll notice as we progress into developing strategy a lot of this you know it's really not going to be that important like i said as long as you just kind of understand that you know what approximately the majority of the values 70 percent is what is considered the value area is fair value but what it is is i really would like to show you why that is and why it is that institutions are using a normal distribution or this type of analysis and this sort of equidistant on each side with a central location so what it is volume profile i've already talked about this before don't get confused by this and think it's beyond you it really is not it's so basic all it is is people are collecting data right and they're basically putting the data into certain buckets on axes so here it could be price right for example it could be height could be iq people's iqs it could be the weight of babies it could be the shoe sizes obviously it could be the price if it's pound dollar bread as you saw in the example i talked about before guys could be anything and then here you're simply looking at the frequency okay and basically what you're doing is you're just collecting a histogram of data where you're simply saying so let's just go through these very quickly you could be saying do you know what majority of height of uh i don't know males is 180 centimeters so the majority of them is going to be here and then actually there might be some 170 there might be some 190 then there's going to be very few that are you know either side and it's going to follow this see what it is if you think about it how many things in life have this central tendency we talked about it pretty much everything on the supermarket shelf right a can of um sort of coke zero uh look i don't know how much it is in the states but obviously i'm from the uk it's about 60p these days quite go tesco go to a corner shop you go here you go there it's really not gonna vary by that much go and do it go and do this experiment go and build a probability distribution a histogram and just go and write down 60p 60 1p 62 63 64 all the way up to like you know two pounds maybe and then zero here it's gonna have what a central tendency are you to agree let's say you go to a thousand stores throughout the country let's be honest almost 90 of them are gonna be somewhere in this region right i agree some might be 65p some might be 55p some odd ones might be 50p right so you're gonna have this can you see where we're going with this and each one of these is no different to a market collecting market orders that's all you're doing in the same way the exchange is collecting this data do you see it's almost like this exchange is doing a survey and looking at market orders that are taking place in the marketplace instead of diet coke it's just futures and they're just recording it and they're building up this sort of histogram and they're just saying do you know what let's just see what sort of shape does it take and it has a central tendency these cokes guys hardly anyone's going to be lucky enough to you might get the odd person where it's near expiry or something or whatever there's some stock issues or whatever i don't know a huge surplus and they might get it for 5p 10p but let's be honest i'm gonna be anywhere near the amount that get it for 60p right so it's going to be this central tendency right and then equally hardly anyone's going to charge two pounds for a can of diet coke or whatever it is that we're looking at central tendency can you see you've got to realize it's a phenomena that takes place in most things in life people's iq levels will follow the same sort of distribution baby's weights they're not gonna vary by a mammoth amount they're gonna be approximately the same shoe sizes for certain ages um you know all men that are 35 go out there ask them their shoe sizes you're gonna find over thousands and thousands and thousands which we have here thousands of market orders they're gonna all be around you know uh obviously i don't only know uk shoe sizes but say 8, 9, 10, 11 that sort of region who's going to be out there with a shoe size of one hardly anyone they all tend to congregate around a central value right guys there's so many examples i could show you so what governments are doing hospitals or clinicians i can't think of the word but you know the people doing these clinical trials and obviously trying to figure things out what they've realized is that they can use this as a sampling method and you know if if for example the government's trying to work out what's the average height of people look it's not it's not practical to send a questionnaire out to six million people or 10 million people how many people live in the country to do a sample and they'll just be trying to figure out what's the probability that the majority fit within a one standard deviation range and we're going to calculate the standard deviation a moment and that's what we're doing can a coke what's the probability that the majority fit within this range how can i compare this to uh birth weight to shoe size to pound dollar because have you noticed guys you don't need to take my word for it that's the beautiful thing about this look at what prices of financial instruments are doing it's human behavior humans love doing things that are habitual where they feel comfortable what did we talk about before on ebay where we said can i'm sorry i'm not trying to cope the iphone right if it's trading a thousand pounds and people can see that previous transactions have taken place at um what about a thousand pounds i put 1k here do you agree the majority of transactions are going to take place there why is that we're going to feel uncomfortable going to 2000 hang on a minute everyone's trading at a thousand i won't do what everyone else does can you see that it's going to be this central tendency you're gonna get the odd lucky guy you know it happens who just happens to catch someone off guard and they get it you know for like five six hundred pounds very rare and then you might get the odd guy who has this sort of desperation i need it tomorrow's my wife's birthday i'm just going to pay 1200 day in 1400 pounds because that's all that's available right so you get the odd few people but the majority are going to take place where the central value of a thousand pounds and look same shape guys it's the beauty of this um um the way that you can see why i look at the markets this way because you've seen guys i'm a very um scientific person i need proof right this is why i hate indicators because as soon as i look at the proof it's easy i can see the garbage when i look at this i find it very hard to dislist this because i'm like hang on a minute the market i don't even need to take anyone's word for it look i'm actually looking at it myself you tell me what shape is this the majority of transactions are taking place around certain values and we see that all the time we see markets get happy and they do what they do this okay they settle around this central value okay the majority of transactions are taking place so i know that's taking a while for me to explain but it's really important that you understand because what's happened historically is to help solve this problem of you know how can we make forecasts and predictions about the likely height of the entire population the iq the birth weights shoe sizes all these sort of things clinical trials as well uh mathematicians historically realized that you know what if something has central tendency as we've seen so many things do financial markets seem to have this central tendency what they realized is there's this measure called standard deviation and all that is is it's looking at how spread out the values are there's this measurement that when you actually use a certain measurement we're going to do it together in a second that no matter what you're looking at height iq birth weight male shoe size pound dollar financial transaction as long as they follow this shape of distribution of values then 68 percent will fall within the exact same range when measured excuse me when measured in standard deviation terms okay so that is where this 68 comes from or 70 all right so hopefully that makes sense that's why we look at standard deviation and basically that is the value area so it's called you know that will be this standard deviation here and it's basically it's called the value area high okay so the standard deviation there which you see here and then you see here where 68 percent 34 plus 34 we just round it up to 70 is we just say look do you know what where by calculating the standard deviation and the machine will do this for you sierra chart does it automatically don't worry you don't need to do it this is what i say don't worry too much about this stuff i just like to explain it to you because i want you to go home comfortable not thinking i envy just take it no don't never take my word for things so i want to explain this to you so if you decided to kind of work this out for yourself you know giving an example here there's probably tons of example for basic standard deviation calculations on the internet but you know i want this to be the best course on the market so that's why i'm doing this because i want to actually derive this to some extent myself and obviously we're not going to do the maths on the previous slide a is irrelevant we'll be here all day trying to do that this is good enough to show you what a standard deviation is so basically it's called a value area high and a value area low for obvious reasons that's the height of the value area and that's the low of the value area and it's just these standard deviations and it's basically where 70 of the data fall and then you've got the mode and the mode all the mode is right so what happens is if you think about it in any statistical data set or any data set let's say you're the government right and you say to a worker let's say you work for the government and all these are is these are descriptive statistics which i don't know maybe it doesn't sound complicated to you maybe it does to some of you isn't it's really basic all it means is let's say you work for the government the government say look can you go and find out the height of um certain age of the population male population or shoe size or whatever and let us know and imagine they did say to you go and find out from every single person so it could be several million might take you some time whatever so you come back with this huge database of values right is it really going to help the government if you say here you go here's six million values or even if you took a sample of 100 people 300 people and said here's 300 value it's going to be meaningless you need some way of describing that data and all that is that's the average okay so the average is a descriptive statistic so the in its most simplistic format it could be like you know you've got um three numbers one two three what's the average is two two describes basically it's the average it describes these numbers in one number are you just looking at the average saying you know what roughly is two basically um if someone said you you know these three data points meant something and I want you to describe them in one number you're going to go for the average aren't you're going to say lies approximately two um and all the standard deviation is doing and we're going to come back to this is looking at the spread because what it is is let's take another example um sorry if you uh for example were to look at um let's say you had three numbers right four five and six what's the average five right pretty straightforward okay these are quite evenly spread out but then what if you had um different numbers so less uh and again look I told you I don't script in this I'm just making this up but so it could go could be a disaster but let's hope not let's see you had two five and eight right what's the average it's the same isn't it it's five three either side but if I tell you in one number a descriptive statistic of these three numbers as being five and same here it's five I you say to me I can only tell you one number because think about it this could be loads of values right it could be loads of values either side um obviously I don't want to give you all the data I want to describe it as an average on average you know it's almost like if you think about it um you see all the time in sport don't you where football teams soccer teams uh obviously in the US it's called soccer over here it's football or hockey or whatever I'm going to talk in football terms because um or cricket terms actually let's use cricket um you know a team scores over a season they might play 50 matches they might score 200 over say 50 overs 200 300 100 150 200 300 this list could go on for 50 matches how many times you say on average they scored 180 you see it's used all the time isn't it it's a descriptive statistic that's all the mean is but the point is that look here does it tell me that the other values are much closer in this scenario to this scenario can you see four five six are very bunched up now two five and eight spread out the mean is the same right so you need some descriptive statistic that tells you the deviation is called you know to deviate is to deviate how much does it move so the standard deviation is just a measure of how spread out values are obviously the standard deviation is going to be bigger here because it's more spread out here the standard deviation is going to be smaller so basically what it's saying is that um 68 of values in one standard deviation in this set of numbers it's going to be in a smaller range whereas here it's going to be very basic and just to hammer home this point we're now going to do a real example where we look at this um but just to sort of for completion sake you know i said i want as long as you come away from this being comfortable that you know what all right as long as 70 of the values fit in here there's a couple of other things you just need to learn that really honestly they're very straightforward um is that this is something called the VPOC which is the mode so the mode is the most common value in a series of data points and honestly the mode and the mean have different advantages and disadvantages um in when you're using VWAP which is um basically the mean all it is it's literally just the average but it's weighted by volume um i'm going to show you that a bit later we don't really look at it in volume profile um and look i'm not going to go into otherwise we're gonna end up having a statistics course right it's irrelevant honestly you can be like i said you can get go down the rabbit hole with mathematics and you're just going to lose sight of what you're actually trying to achieve here we're trying to um sort of figure out where you've got bigger problems to worry about as i said there's different values across different time horizons and you've got much bigger things to worry about than how precise you are with here um so look if a lot of this is going over your head honestly don't worry about it keep going over this a few times and i promise you will get it if you don't let me know obviously but um you'll see that it really is not important to be precise however um i'm just going to tell you again for completion sake that on a volume profile and it will become obvious to you why we want to look at the most common value here because think about it you know like i said with the iphone example and so on and so forth we want to know where did the most transactions take place and that is it's called the volume point of control because in theory it should have the most control over price because price should always want to want to reach there right because like in an ebay auction the price always wants to go to where previous transactions have taken place the most so that's why we look at that as the mode which is just the most frequently occurring that's all it is honestly don't over complicate it it's nothing more than that it's just and the system will do this for you just literally on your volume profile where you saw those individual um contract numbers it's just where the most contracts took place at a price point and it's marked by a green number and in theory that's where the market should be very attracted to you but honestly i tell you from years of experience um it's never going to work that way what will happen is this is why i tell people you need time to learn the market you have to observe it and believe it for yourself you'll notice that you know if the market is out of balance it's down here and we get into the value area low and we start to test it and test it and we break into it you know you're thinking you want to go to balance guys it's it's never gonna be like boom to the point yeah brilliant crystal ball i got this not gonna work like that what's actually going to happen is um and again this will come with experience you'll notice is that what the market will do is it will do stuff like this come up and it might stop there then come off and then it might get closer and then come off and then it might overshoot and then come off can you see what's happening it's approximate be very roughly in this region people find it hard to accept i'm sorry you're just going to have to accept it the market will never go to this magical point it's going to be very rough and you know this is where discretion will come in you'll obviously be reading this and you know we'll do some of that together but for now just understand that that's why we use the mode as a descriptive statistic i.e the most common rather than the average because the average doesn't make sense here it makes sense to look at the most common value as the major focal point that's why it's called the point of control but with a vwap and we're going to do a whole section on vwap it makes more sense for us to look at the average as a sort of descriptive statistic because what's happening with the vwap is the vwap is um it's a volume weighted average price and essentially is developing throughout the day so much more accurate measure of what the sort of average price achieved by the market is throughout the day and let's leave it there because otherwise we're gonna end up going way off topic and we are going to come back to the vwap but just understand that in the following example when we calculate the mean which everyone has done the average is the thing that i refer to as the vwap and when we're working out the um the mode is basically the vpoc which is there and then standard deviation is essentially um just you know how distributed these these values are because if you think about it if the distribution is very much more you know here the values are quite scrunched up but if you get for example um let's look at this and apologies we are just about to move on to the next stage but obviously i needed to go through all of these would you agree that um here look it's obvious right can you see the standard deviation here the range is going to be smaller isn't it than this okay because the values are more spread out so i don't mean in absolute terms i mean in sort of number of points range do you see what i mean so let's say this was um i don't know pound dollar this is 100 pips that's going to be more like uh 20 to 30 pips or whatever i'm just making up these numbers but you you see my point and there's still one standard deviation apart so actually telling us the same thing 70 percent of the data 70 percent of the data but it's just more spread out that's why we use this standard definition because if we didn't it'd be very difficult for us to compare this to this we shouldn't be able to compare them that's why we use the normal distribution because it has this mathematical property when you square the variances and then you do the square root of the average of those which we're going to do in a second together you can compare them on a standardized basis so let's go on and do that and then we're going to pretty much end up finishing off the chapter so i'll see you on the next slide okay traders so we're going to quickly or as quickly as possible look at a real life example and we're just going to try and understand how do we actually calculate mean mode and standard deviation and you know for completion there is this thing called a median you may have heard of it again it's well over exaggerated how complicated it's really not it's just a middle value we don't really use it it's meaningless the middle value doesn't tell us anything because it doesn't take into account what you know the amount of volume that's taking place the median is a little bit like using technical analysis it's very sort of linear weighted there's no weighting given and i talked about this in one of the previous sections you know that towards the end or i said there were 9999 transactions taking place at one price i can't remember it's almost like you're ignoring all of that so we don't want to do that we do actually want to do what we want to acknowledge that at this price price one there's that many transactions and at price two say this one there was that many transactions right obviously it's ludicrous for us just to um you know not take that into account whereas obviously the mode and the mean takes volume at each level into account in the sense that mode we already know it's just the most frequently occurring and then we're going to look at standard deviation as i said which gives us some sort of standard measure of how spread out the values are and we can compare that equally across the same types of distributions so let's crack on and look at so i've got this data off the internet um someone did a survey already where they took the height of 30 30 year old males it's not a big sample but look at the end of the day to prove the point we don't want to be here with a thousand data points we're not going to achieve much we're going to be able to achieve the same thing just by looking at 30 data points and i highly recommend you do this yourself go and find you know if you want if you want um is it going to help you become a better trader probably not as if i'm honest with you like i said those of you without the mathematical background are probably better off because you're gonna not take this stuff in the precise way um luckily i've managed to detach myself many years ago from it but obviously if you don't face the issue you don't have to overcome it in the first place you're okay you know if you can get this you're fine but you know if you want and you've got some time on your hands do it by all means nothing wrong with it and prove to yourself that so many things out there have a central tendency so what do i mean by that again i've said it a few times but so what this chap did on the internet is he asked 30 people random males um you know what's the height and this was the results so basically what i did is i just plotted it myself in excel i can show you how to do this if you see my coronavirus analysis that i did on instagram um which is really really strong analysis where i looked at the range and you remember the range of the market it had what a central tendency it's really unbelievable how um this sort of bell-shaped distribution is everywhere in life um and by the way you know i can't help myself but i have a knockout technical analysis and i'm going to but i back it up and i know people say is why is bashing it so much but i back it up fibonacci people use fibonacci is the it's just honestly it boggles my mind because do you know that how fibonacci numbers were created it was to solve this problem of um trying to predict the exponential growth rate in uh the rabbit population okay guys it's just nonsense people are using mathematics that was observable in the reproductive rate of rabbits and trying to apply it to financial markets it's complete nonsense okay if you actually even took two three minutes to look at it properly you'd see that that's why i'm doing this because it's important we prove it to ourselves and all you need to do is observe what's the actual market doing is it following the same rate of reproductive production of rabbits i mean rubbish i'm not saying that fibonacci golden ratios and whatever don't appear in nature they do the financial market's not nature it's not you know it's not nature guys you know one of the reasons why we've got this coronavirus issue going on is because we're doing things that don't conform to nature right we're human beings we're emotional we do all these irrational things and normal distribution takes that into account in the sense that yeah there is a central tendency but you get these odd occasions where we go out we go out we have these emotional periods and it you know and those periods are less than the ones that are in the bulk okay so normal distribution you can just observe it it follows that pattern okay so you've got to be very careful this is what i mean when someone tells you use fibonacci use this use that stop for a moment and actually think that you know what is that mathematics based on so it's useful purpose but no you know normal distribution and the balancing type of tendency that think of the word balance what does it mean central tendency the the tendency of markets is very very closely aligned to normal distributions and proof's in the pudding every single financial institution in the world is using normal distribution to look at measures of description of their data their profits their you know obviously financial market analysis and so on and so forth look don't get me wrong it's not there's no model in the world that's 100 perfect and i know i've gone a little bit off topic here but i haven't it's important you understand this that at the end of the day in an ideal world transactions would have taken place here here here here here do you see what i mean and it would be very smooth as we saw in um here right this area here it's not that's as close as you're going to get look how close it is this is what the problem was with me being a mathematician is i found it hard to accept no it has to be exactly the perfect this that and i you know i've come to terms with that many years ago because i realized it was holding me back so um and i'm you know i hope you don't mind me constantly saying this point it's because i do want to put at ease a lot of people who um think and i know there's this perception that oh people in institutional um environments are all these clever whiz kids and that's what the differentiating factor honestly is not because can you see you're never going to find the perfect model and people from those backgrounds including myself causes big problems when you try to be very very precise just just get the gist of it which i'm going to show you now um but at least understand why we're even looking at it and the institutions are looking at this and not Fibonacci because the maths make sense we see it everywhere everything has a central tendency uh not everything but many things but financial markets do they've shown it to us time and time again and we've got this wonderful thing called a standard deviation which has these beautiful mathematical properties where we can compare everything that has the same shape and say within two standard deviation range 70 of values are going to fall 70 is approximately the majority two standard deviations 95 of values are going to fall so um let's crack on with this example so with these heights right um i plotted them myself so this is a table i made myself in excel like i said if you want me to help you to do this i can but obviously i've done this in the intro as you can see i like talk a lot so there's no time to obviously do the excel example with you and can you see central tendency guys the majority of males that are 30 are you know round about 179 180 it makes sense you know in the high five feet stroke six foot range um can you see we've got the same problem though um we need to figure out kind of where does the majority where's the value area where's the majority of data where is the range within which 70 of males in the entire country excuse me are likely to fall how can we do that standard deviation all right so how do we calculate standard deviation and the mean right we want to know like this rough number on average i talked about the cricket scores on average where are they and um that's what we're going to do now so we're going to work out the mean mode standard deviation mean is the vwap mode is the vpoc right and the standard deviation is the standard deviation okay or the value area i beg your pardon value area okay so let's just remind ourselves value area vpoc vwap will be somewhat in here but we don't use it on volume profile we actually use it as a line and obviously don't get too worried about we're going to do a whole section on the vwap but um let's actually go and calculate these these values okay so here we are i've put all the um the data together nicely and i know my head covers this but really i didn't want to get rid of this so just please excuse me for one moment whilst my head covers this table but essentially don't worry about it's exactly the same table that you saw here okay it's just just basically here it's the same table and obviously you can see the distribution is exactly the same okay and so all i've done is basically i've worked out the mean the average you know it's like honestly it's like taking two numbers one and two and saying what's the mean it's average it's 1.5 isn't it that simple um what we're doing though when you have volume weighted average price because i don't really want to cover this in the vwap section that's why i've mentioned it here i do want to cover it here what we're actually doing is honestly it's very simple what you see what a simple average does is and this is the problem with technical analysis as i said to you previously where you had i think in one of the sections where i showed um was it pound dollar i think 150 135 120 maybe i can't remember exactly and i said there were 9999 here or it may have been down here i can't remember but basically um in fact i think it was near the bottom wasn't it i said that there were bulk of transactions here but and there was very little up here it's like just saying well it's 150 and uh 120 and let's just take the average of 150 over 120 um and obviously you're gonna get what 135 it's nonsense isn't it every transaction took place at 120 so what you really need to do is you need to write down 120 plus 120 plus 120 plus 120 9999 times plus 150 and then divide it by 10 000 your number is going to be like 1.200 and a very small uh number close to 120 it's weighted by volume and guys you've got to understand that's the right way to do it why do i say that improve it to you so would you agree this is the distribution of heights can you see 180 centimeters there which was obviously that central value look 180 180 180 180 180 the way that technical analysis will do it is it will just say oh the average is 180 plus uh so just do 174 plus 175 plus 176 plus plus plus plus plus these etc etc it will come up to 180 so plus 180 plus 181 plus 182 big garbage right at the end of the day we can see 180 it's happened one two three four five six do you see what i mean there's been more than one occurrence of it what happens in financial markets right if you've got the price and the market is moving to get one occurrence at this price get loads of occurrences do you remember get lots of market orders can you see how ludicrous it is what's happening with technical analysis it's basically ignoring this it's ignoring this and just saying nope everybody took place once let's just take the simple mean no you're taking into account that there were more at 180 and there was less at 185 it's a fair way to do it right even exponential you see some of these moves complete garbage why is that it's applying more weight into the front numbers right what does that mean don't mean anything what does that mean does that you know there'll be more transactions taking place more recently than before completely ludicrous when you actually think about it and sorry i know i get animated it's because it's important to me you know i want people to start to see how misled they've been you know and it really cheeses me off that the industry is making a fool of us that's what it's doing right it's making a fool of us i mean come on this this stuff is the correct way to do it we have to take into account the number of occurrences and that's all i've done okay um is so what the volume weighted average price is doing is it will just say all right 180 times 6 plus 181 times 3 plus 182 times 2 do you see what i mean it's just taking into account or you can write them all down but 100,000 contracts in a day at different market orders at all different prices you can if you want write down 100,000 different prices and do you know what i've actually done this not 100,000 but you may have noticed there's a cme reset period where the volume profile resets at the start of the day i hate taking people's word for it so i've actually done this a few times um many years ago is i calculated it myself when it had gone to like five minutes ten minutes and there were a few hundred manageable i took the depth of market and i actually wrote down every single price and every single number of contracts and i divided it by the number to prove to myself that vwap all it's doing is instead of this being heights of adults is the market price and then i looked at the occurrences what is this do you remember on your volume profile you used to have that number where it would tell you 10,826 contracts and which one this is it's the same thing guys 10,826 contracts do you remember what i mean this thing that look this is a frequency distribution that is what this is it's amazing isn't it it's exactly the same thing okay it's identical that's all we're doing is we're just taking the weighted average and that's all the vwap is okay so obviously i'm not going to sit here and i'm not going to add all these up and divide by 30 but you can do it if you want it's basically 179.4 so can you see basically that the mean is slightly different to the mode the feedback is 180 can you see that it's 180 and what you'll find then look i don't want to get too because again it's not really relevant um but you know obviously i'm quite familiar with this because i studied statistics to a very high level um but you don't need to honestly you don't need to to even know what i'm about to tell you you can probably do a bit of googling if you want in your spare time again i'm not here to give anyone a statistics class because i really don't think it's relevant but if this is slightly skewed to this side there will be differences between obviously the most commonly occurring and the mean because obviously the mean is going to be skewed by more occurrences taking place on one side than the other there will be excuse me slight differences between the mode and the i think that's my body trying to tell me that i've probably been talking way too much and i'm probably sending everyone off into non-concentration zone now so i'll try and be as quick as possible but yeah essentially that is the VWAP is the weighted average obviously here with heights it's nice because if your government like i said says to you look go and find out the approximate height of 30 year olds you can say to them do you know what it's about 179.4 right you could say to them it's 180 in this particular circumstance maybe a better measure is the weighted average but like i said in volume profile for the reasons mentioned in the previous page the market technicians anyway not technicians but you know market profilers or volume profile technicians do like to and banks and institutions they do like to look at the VPOC because at the end of the day that's where the most transactions took place so it makes more sense from a financial markets perspective but there's no right or wrong answer and like i said as long as you're roughly in the ballpark that's okay and then we look at the standard deviation okay so i'm not actually going to sit here and do the calculation with you but if you get a chance i highly recommend you do it what basically the standard deviation does is honestly it's not complicated it's a measure of deviation how much does something deviate from what this central value the mean okay so we already said that the mean was what 179.4 do you remember the previous example i gave you with i think five eight and two and five six and four and obviously the six five six four had a very small spread how do we measure this when all we're doing is like um and honestly i can't remember exactly but forgive me if i got this slightly wrong but i think it was this was it five eight and two can you see we're just the mean is five the mean is five here would you agree can you see if it varies by one here this varies by three this varies by one it's more spread out this is more spread out right the problem is right and i don't know if you've ever done any sort of basic statistics before again if you haven't please don't think i'm saying you need to honestly don't worry about it you can get yourself up to speed pretty quickly and if you want to it's really not that difficult i'd highly suggest you try it is what you can do is you can say look in this example either side it's one the difference between the mean four five and six is five and how much does do the three values deviate from the average five whether it's one either side you see the problem with doing that when you're doing this for values because we see it here right we can say okay in the first observation it's 185 it was you see it was quite a fair distance it's quite a fair distance it was quite a fair distance so that was a small distance observation four was this so you're just comparing each in in the same way you're comparing four to five and six to five it's just more values that's what we're just comparing this how much does it deviate from my average value because in an ideal world everything would be here but it's not is it we know financial markets do what this you see what they're doing exactly what heights are doing they tend to vary a little bit and you'll see here if you had a distribution which is this how does it look like that it's the same thing guys amazing isn't it the height of 30 year old males follows a balancing financial market okay and i've shown it to you i've proven it to you and you can prove it yourself quite easily but you want to look at how dispersed are these so coming back to this example see part of the problem is if you look at the mean right here if you do six minus five what do you get one if you do four minus five what do you get minus one what's minus one plus one zero what you'll find is if you you can do this yourself i highly recommend it do 185 minus 179.4 177 which is what you're all you're doing is that's 185 minus 179.4 you're comparing the distance there distance here if you added all these distances up it's going to equal zero okay because they're all equidistant aren't they they're all equidistant in terms of that's the whole point of the average and if you look here what's the difference here eight minus five is three and you could say yeah but that's more than one but hang on a minute what about two two minus five is minus three what's minus three plus three zero you see you can't compare zero and zero that makes sense so to overcome this what mathematicians have done is they square these values and i'm not going to do this for every single one but essentially what they've they do is they just multiply the number by each other so if you're not familiar with it all you're doing is you're saying one times one is one a minus one times minus one is one so it actually becomes a positive number when you add them up i'm not going to do it for every single one but essentially what you're doing is you're just squaring each one of these deviations right how much does the actual deviate from the mean that's why it's called the standard deviation and actually what mathematicians found is if they take the square root of that it fits perfectly into a distribution where that number that you get when you square root it it's called a standard deviation and it encompasses 68 percent why well that's why we just it's pointless we don't need to get into all of this there is a mathematical reason why when you take the square of every variant and do the square root of it you come up with this number called the standard deviation it's a standard deviation and every single distribution that follows a frequency distribution that follows this sort of normal distribution shape that standard deviation value 68% of all your values will always fall within a standard deviation either side okay so let me bring this to life for you so what i did is i did the square right so i took i did 185 minus 179 before 177 minus 179 before 180 minus blah blah blah if you do the sum of all of these 30 numbers you're going to get zero so i squared them and then i took the square root okay and what i came up with was uh where is it so i took the average variation which i talked about already and then um what did i do you sum or square them so i took the square root okay and the standard deviation was 2.6 so guys let me bring this life to life for you all it's saying is the standard deviation right the average deviation is 2.6 centimeters so what it's doing is it's saying this value here okay one stand that's the symbol for standard deviation it's just saying that that is 2.6 centimeters so what does that mean did you remember it said one standard deviation all it's saying is if i add 2.62 i mean 179.4 which is what 182 so can you see that 182 and look i drew it by hand and i almost got the answer this is why i say please don't get bogged down in maths honestly you're gonna um you're just doing yourself no favors i pretty much got it by eye okay but i just wanted to show you that this is what institutions are doing because they get a machine to be a little bit more precise and draw this on for them and then what they what you do is so one standard deviation is 2.6 centimeters that way and we just do the same the other side so we do 179.4 minus 2 is 177.4 and then you've got 176.8 isn't it so 176.8 and that is so i was almost right it's somewhere in that region there so i wasn't that far off okay so all this is telling us is there's a 70 chance okay that male heights will fall between just below 177 and obviously 182 okay now i know some guy who's watching this probably done statistics to a very high level and say hang on you should have done n minus one because it's a sample um and it's not the whole population i don't want to get into all of that i recognize that okay but listen we're not you know we're trading human emotions here as we've seen the doesn't matter i just want to acknowledge that as a side note to anyone who's done statistics i know they're gonna think that and look i'm aware of that okay but let's um not get into that because honestly defeats it just won't it's irrelevant and it doesn't really matter the point is that um in financial markets um when we're looking at value areas especially in a historical basis we are looking at the whole population because we're basically looking at every single market order that has taken place okay so what's happening basically is all the market um is doing and in fact i'll come back to this in one second so we are we're almost done now is i want to show you something on the next slide that um the standard deviation is incredibly useful for the following reasons so let's just go to the next slide okay so what i've done here is and honestly don't um you know get what to be worried about oh my god what's going on here honestly it's um it is very very simple all i've done is i've taken this i've scrunched it up a little bit and i've taken this data so the data you see here and this is basically this okay do you remember where it was 180 and this is what we've just been looking at i've just basically scaled it so i can compare it to the exact same experiment done where the values were much more spread out can you see here would you agree compared to the mean look it's almost like a financial market that was balancing in a very small range okay that's what we've just been looking at male heights now imagine you had a market that was much more spread out it transacted at much wider values and more frequently can you see you can have a wider range right this is wider than that isn't it right um we said what the standard deviation was 2.6 centimeters do you remember in the previous example that we've just been looking at just rewind it if you if you don't remember um and therefore uh what did we say we said it was about didn't we remember that i just did that 179.4 plus 2.6 and obviously this was just below 178 right so one standard deviation one standard deviation would you agree that the standard deviation therefore you don't even need to know what standard deviation is on any measure of spread look at this would you agree this is more spread out than this right it's very thin obviously the measure of spread has to be bigger but look when i did the same calculation guys i can send you this data we can do it together if you want if you're really interested i'm more than happy to do that with someone where you can work this out for yourself i can send you the data um and in fact this is the data for the i believe this is the data for um the more spread out no it isn't it isn't i don't have it here but i can send it to you if you want all i've done is i've just used slightly more spread out data look what happened i worked out the standard deviation it's almost double do you see that so 5.1 can you see the mean is almost identical do you remember in that example where i had five and then we had two and we had eight and then i had five um and then we had four and six well hang on the means the same someone says what's the average right um it's like in the cricket example if someone if a team has three matches and they score 200 runs they score 300 runs and they score 100 runs you can say on average they scored 200 but what if another team scored 150 runs 200 runs and 250 runs it's still 200 but you see it was it was less spread out the volatility the variability was a lot less in the second example that's what we're measuring here can you see by comparing the variability the deviations in the way that i showed in the previous example um with this data set i got standard deviation of 5.1 what does that mean all we're doing is we just add one standard deviation this way and we add one standard deviation this way and you get 5.1 from the mean of let's just round it up and say you know it's about 180 if you add five what are you getting about 185 as the value area high and 180 minus 5 is what it's about 175 it's there and look here can you see this is your value area for this data and look how thin this value area is compared to that can you see it makes sense right because look at this range smaller and this is wider because of this mathematical properties which you don't need to worry about but can you see why they use them because now we can compare this to this and i hope this finally makes sense because i know i hope you can understand why to explain it in this way slowly all you're saying is 70 of the data there's a 70 chance in this distribution that um values will fall within um basically whatever it was was it one about 185 right and 175 how do we compare that but we want to see where the 70 we can say here there's 70 probability that actually the same thing's going to happen but this time in a smaller range there's about 182 and just below 178 you see i can compare them now i can compare them do you now see what's going on here and why we use standard deviations because i'm going to leave that here because i want you to see these two are comparable i can now say hang on that's one standard deviation uh let's get rid of this little bit of ink here okay this is potentially i mean i haven't got it up on me but the computer sierra will calculate this for you value area high value at low value area high value area low you see i can start to compare them now because i can say that's 70 that's 70 that's the vpoc that's the vpoc the mean i don't care about but the vwap i do care and we also care about standard deviation and that is what the bands will be it's just a standard deviation but you know like i said professional firms are not going to explain this to you i hope it was helpful that i explained this to you if you don't get it honestly reach out to me i love this stuff i'll try and explain it to you a different way or go on google have a look at basic standard deviation examples if you really want to get it but honestly really not going to make a difference as long as you can accept that within a standard deviation range that's your value area and you're going to get 68 and then when it comes to vwap you'll see we also look at the second standard deviation and that is 95 because what it helps is it helps obviously institutions to see are we are we extremes are we extremes has the market moved to where you know there's less than a five percent chance that we're gonna enter this zone so you can see probability wise it's not a great bet we're more likely 95 percent to do what move into sort of sorry this region here 95 percent chance that we're going to actually stay within this region so if we start to go to extremes you see me trade this all the time right what do you see me do when there's a little v profile bump and i take it out and then i take it return back why do you think i'm doing that value areas okay that's what i'm looking at but on the volume profile i'll be honest with you it's got to the stage where even i and i'll prove it to you proof's in the pudding do you see me mark the value areas on my volume profile i don't mark them i prefer to visualize them because of this thing that i keep saying and that is the mathematics is too precise for something that is imprecise i don't look as long as it's rough it's helpful to me i can just see it because sierra will draw it on and other market professionals i know they're going to be looking at it but can you see the problem already that's not a perfect normal distribution because look ideally i want to see values in there here i want to see values there here see i've accepted that you know life's not perfect i can't say to people oh do me a favor do you mind transacting here so my profile can be exact so i can draw precise value it's not how markets work they're imprecise so there's got to be some sort of leeway given to these value areas okay now i'm gonna be up front with you and this is also going to give you some relief those of you that are getting a bit too worried about the maths that i've been talking about guys what i'm going to do is right at first i want you to look at value areas but i'm going to be honest with you i've recognized this problem that i faced earlier in my career where i was very technical and i was a mathematician and i used to be so obsessed with these value areas have you noticed i don't even have them on i don't actually draw them on my volume profiles i use them on market profile and i'm going to come to that when i show you market profile because what i'm doing is with market profile is i like to merge so i can put this area into here and can you see it makes it it rounds it out and it helps me draw nice smooth profiles then i like to look at standard deviation because in the normal distribution sense because it forms nice smooth distributions like this and look i know for some of you a lot of you be like this is way over my head maybe i'm wrong maybe all of you get it but some of you may not honestly don't worry keep practicing it will come it will come can't expect to get you know something like this overnight um you know i've never seen it happen for anyone it takes time take your time a bit go back watch it um i think unless i'm mistaken that's pretty much everything we've covered that i wanted to cover um yeah i hope that was helpful i've now shown you um you know on uh let's just recap because might as well taken so long anyway um so what i've shown you i've shown you that how we measure this is looking at the average deviation of every single value to the mean um i've shown you so i've shown you what the standard deviation is i've shown you what the uh volume point of control is and i'm sorry but i've just realized one thing and what it is is right i have to say this because technically someone could pick me up on this and they're gonna be right and unfortunately it's going to confuse you slightly but honestly it is not going to make a difference so what it is is when vwap is calculated okay um and this will become more clear and i'm going to go over this again when we look at vwap and the standard deviation bands vwap is just a measure of what the volume weighted average price is when you see standard deviation bands um on the vwap what they're doing is they're doing exactly what you see here they're calculating the average deviation and then doing the whole squaring and square routing process to come up with one standard deviation as a sort of measure of dispersion and that's what forms the band right as the market's going like this you get these little value areas here and obviously that's two standard deviations what the volume profile does and you know there's no particular reason for it it's just the way it's been done for a very long time is rather than looking at this mean it's actually looking at um the mode so the most frequently occurring so this basically so you see the mean is 179.4 which actually isn't 180 it's more like there what volume profile does is it will take the mode and then it will just keep going out until it spreads out 70 percent we call it 68 there's actually a setting in the volume profile where you can change it but the default is i think it's 68 everyone uses 70 i use 70 like i said you see even i'm not being precise it doesn't matter so it kind of makes this next point redundant i'm only putting this in because i know someone and within their right to do so they're going to say hang on mv isn't volume profile done by calculating the average deviation from the mode the point of control and they'd be right so i'm just going to put that in here that basically what volume profile does is and it's called volume value area and what it's doing is it's basically going through the same process but rather than using 179.4 it's using 180 can you see it really is not going to make a big difference generally in most balanced profile shapes i'm going to make any difference but technically that's what it's doing and the vwap is actually using the mean the variance basically how much do all the actual values vary from the mean for the vwap and how much do the actual values vary from the mode okay for the volume profile that we see so there is a slight difference there's no right or wrong way of doing it that's what i'm going to sit here and justify it doesn't matter honestly guys you're going to realize this as your career progresses the best traders in the world look at this and realize it for what it is it's perfect mathematics trying to fit to a slightly imperfect market so you know if you if you're off slightly here and there you're going to make no difference you're going to be a better trader for it that's why i actually say and i genuinely meant it people have never done this before they're actually better off because for me it took me a couple years to get it through my head that do you know what nv um just it works pretty well in real life but it doesn't work um precisely and this is the final thing i'm going to say and i'm going to say it because it's true you know i'm not going to hold things back from you just because we've been talking for two hours and i'm thinking oh well i'm going to leave that piece of information up it's taking me too long no i'm going to tell you because it's the truth and um that is and this is the final point i'm going to make the reason why i wouldn't be too concerned about you know the maths is because notice this profile right it's fairly balanced on this date look what's happened here see you've got a balance here but you've actually got a different balance here so what probably happened probably i don't know for certain but um because i don't mark the open and close on my profile but what probably happened is the market either opened here and it was in a balance right and then something happened maybe data or something and it became imbalanced and then it balanced here as opposed to here where it balanced what happens is your software um it's not practical for you to keep chopping and changing so actually here work out standard deviation here no what your software is going to do is it's going to work and every single institutional platform algorithm whatever when they're looking at value areas it's going to work out the value area for this entire day do you see the problem it's going to work out the value area for the entire day and give you these two regions and you see over time i've recognized that this is nonsense in this type of distribution what does that mean this value area i mean anything because there's two distributions here there's so much data missing here that didn't transact here we don't have that problem so much here we don't have that problem here we've got the same problem look do you see what i just i got rid of them basically i'm going to be honest with you i've been very clear and i've said i'll tell you what professional firms are doing what i'm doing slightly differently it's up to you this is why i can't give you the answers i can take you 95% of the way there can you see that the other five percent you need to work out what's comfortable for you i can tell you what i'm doing i don't want you to do what i'm doing just because i'm doing it i'm doing this because to me from years of observation i thought logically that doesn't make sense to me why would i take a normal distribution value area for this it doesn't look like this here it does this day was balanced what happened here we probably opened like this went in balanced and then we settled into a range that's not the same as what if we do that it assumes we had we didn't do that we didn't do that on this day do you see that's the limitations and that's the problem of looking at things too much from the precise mathematical lens guys i'll tell you right now trading in the vanilla sense not the option structure products i talked about it is it's an art it's not a science you've got to be able to um look at things from a different perspective a different angle that an algorithm can't do and say to yourself do you know what i'm going to make a judgment call here that makes sense to me here probably the value area is more like that and then we've got a small one there okay and then here maybe that's okay maybe it's not i don't know do you see what the guy sitting next to me in the trading floor in a professional environment he might decide that's value and less value whereas i might decide you know what looks okay and this is where we come to where discretion sometimes has to be applied and across different obviously time horizons you can see that it can get quite um complicated so look we've done enough i think and we'll obviously revisit this again and again and again about value areas and there'll be things that i mention um to you just to hammer this home i hope that was really useful you now understand what value areas are volume point of control and how we measure fair value and what we're going to do is um i believe don't quote me on this because i haven't actually built the section yet but i think we're now going to start to uh obviously we're going to move away from theory and we're going to look at um either market profile or volume profile one of the profiles and we're going to start developing contextual levels around them that we can trade off and we're going to really start looking at excuse me these value areas as areas that we can actually take trades from so you know is the market balanced here and we see um some sort of trading opportunities to get back into balance which you saw me do on the depth of market or is the market going imbalanced and now as you see we've defined what the value area high is we're leaving the value area the market obviously won't do it in a straight line let's be honest you know we're kidding ourselves if that's what we think it will obviously do it in you know a very jagged manner i do that and then you might start to build some value here and you'll see the volume profile build which is why i had you on the depth of market because when you see it what i've seen is on the depth of market is building value i've built some value here above the base value area and we can start to think about taking long positions into an imbalanced trade um or could come back in we start to build some value before below the value area high and start to think let's take a mean reversion trade okay so we're going to start to build some of these contextual levels and then i'm going to really help you put together and develop some edge um which you know the sort of things i was shown in a professional environment in fact the exact same things and better and then you can use that obviously um towards the as the pro course comes to the conclusion um and how you can develop trading strategies either using what i show you and then making obviously uh the ideal thing is you'd make slight tweaks based on your observation so yeah look forward to the next section i wanted to put that in so you know there's some good stuff to look forward to i know this was long but i hope you can see i needed to get this theory out of the way it's really really important um that it was put somewhere in the course and uh yeah maybe again take a little bit of a break because um you know there's only so much of my voice you can put up with without needing a break so um finally i appreciate you letting me put the bit about my dog at the start as well and really wanted to like i say um i didn't want that to affect the quality that i put into this section or any going forward so if anything you know i've really gone all out on this section because um i want people to really a understand that i'm genuine when i say don't worry about it if you don't have a mathematical background i've really tried to be honest with you and say genuinely you are at an advantage as long as you can you know generally get what i'm saying when i talk about deviation as in spread average spread obviously the mean and mode so you can get that generally the gist of it you're much further ahead than someone like me who used to be so pedantic about nope it's 34.1 percent standard deviation it has to be this level and literally the market gave my backside a kicking so many times until i got it all right i'm gonna have to give this thing a little bit of flex so anyway i've said the same things over and over again have a great day and i'll see you in the next section
